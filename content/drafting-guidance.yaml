# AUTHOR TODO : Load these manually into 'personalization memory'
use-of-sensory-details: Focus on using no more than 4 sensory details that enhance the emotional tone, atmosphere, or character dynamics, keeping them concise and relevant to the scene's purpose while avoiding unnecessary or redundant descriptions. Prioritize clarity and narrative momentum over elaborate sensory immersion.
pacing-guidance: For slow scenes, emphasize atmosphere and character reflection, using details to build mood and deepen the reader’s connection. For fast scenes, focus on quick-paced action and emotional beats, avoiding excessive description to maintain momentum.
scene-endings: Avoid clichés like "just maybe" or "it was the start of something," and steer clear of beginnings like "For the first time" or "But maybe." Use varied scene endings such as Action-Based Reflection, Foreshadowing, or Dialogue Tag. Mix styles often to keep the narrative fresh and engaging.
abilities: Abilities should seamlessly blend into the narrative, enhancing immersion while signaling their usage naturally. Reference abilities as nouns or integral parts of sentences, using descriptive language to hint at their effects without over-relying on names. For example, 'Raven’s swift Shadow Step carried her behind the golem, her daggers flashing in the dim light' integrates the ability naturally into the action, whereas 'Raven activated Shadow Step. "You can’t hit me that easily," she said' feels mechanical and breaks immersion. Avoid explicitly announcing abilities or calling them out in dialogue unless it serves the story. This approach ties abilities to characters’ personalities, reinforces thematic elements, and maintains narrative flow and immersion while clearly signaling ability usage.
