          Reference: See "Recurring Motifs" under Themes, Narrative Guide.
        progression: >
          Early dungeon dives highlight their clashing styles: Raven’s shadows obscure Luke’s light, and his protective 
          tendencies limit her bold maneuvers. Over time, they learn to complement each other, with light and shadow working 
          together seamlessly. In the final dungeon, synchronized light and shadow abilities visually symbolize their mutual trust.

          - "Dungeon environments frequently juxtapose areas of intense light and shadow, creating symbolic backdrops for their partnership."
          - "Gear and abilities reflect the motif, with Raven’s dark armor and shadow-infused abilities contrasting Luke’s paladin gear and radiant light magic."
