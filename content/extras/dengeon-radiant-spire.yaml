type: dungeon
name: "Radiant Spire"
difficulty: "Extreme (Lethal)"
description: >
  A floating citadel of pure light, suspended high above an endless sky. The Radiant Spire
  is not a battle of strength—it is a trial of teamwork and trust.
  Unlike other dungeons, the Radiant Spire does not seek to destroy intruders with malice—it tests them with unwavering precision. 
  Every challenge demands absolute coordination between two divers, and those who fail are not granted second chances.
  Only partners in perfect harmony will live. Only those who enter in perfect trust will survive to the end.

narrative-purpose: >
  The Spire represents a critical point in Luke and Raven’s partnership: 
  Do they trust each other enough to survive this?

challenges:
  - name: "The Luminous Ascent"
    description: >
      A vertical climb up a shifting tower of radiant platforms—each one appearing and disappearing 
      in rhythmic pulses of light. The platforms are not solid for both divers simultaneously; 
      only one can stand on them at a time.
    mechanics:
      - "One diver must step forward as the other steps back, ensuring the platforms remain stable."
      - "If one moves too fast, the other will fall to their death."
      - "Misjudging a jump or losing sync results in immediate, irreversible failure."

  - name: "The Guardians of Harmony"
    description: >
      Towering golden statues with blazing halos, standing at the threshold of the Spire’s inner sanctum. 
      They do not attack—but they respond violently to disharmony.
    mechanics:
      - "The statues demand perfectly synchronized strikes—if one diver hits too early or too late, 
         the guardians unleash a radiant blast that disintegrates the attacker."
      - "The only way forward is to match pace, match force, match intent—the very essence of unity."
      - "A single mistake results in instant death."

  - name: "The Bridge of Light"
    description: >
      A path of pure, blinding radiance stretching into the sky. The bridge only exists when both divers advance together—
      if one lags behind, the path disappears beneath their feet.
    mechanics:
      - "Moving out of sync causes the bridge to vanish beneath one diver, sending them plummeting."
      - "The light flickers in response to movement—if one hesitates, both are stranded midair, leading to fatal collapse."
      - "There is no saving someone who falls."

final-challenge:
  name: "The Heart of Light"
  description: >
    The Radiant Spire’s core is a living embodiment of light’s true nature—not just power, but caution, balance, and trust. 
    It does not fight. It watches. It judges. And it presents the final test: one diver must leap into the void, 
    trusting the other to catch them.
  mechanics:
    - "At the climax, the path abruptly ends. One diver must jump forward into empty space, 
       knowing that if the other does not react, they will fall to their death."
    - "The second diver must reach out and bridge the gap, activating the Spire’s final passage."
    - "If they hesitate, miscalculate, or do not trust completely—one of them dies."
    - "Only those who understand the true meaning of unity and caution will survive."

rewards:
  - name: "Luminous Vow"
    description: >
      A pair of rings with System description, 'Exchange these rings and make a vow. Gain 5 levels. If either partner breaks the vow, you both die.'

symbolic-meaning:
  - "The Radiant Spire is not about destruction—it is about trust. It demands precision, and absolute coordination."
  - "There is no room for second chances—recklessness is punished, hesitation is fatal, and only those who fully trust their partner can succeed."
  - "By the end, Luke and Raven have proven their bond in a way that no mere words or training could ever achieve."
  - "This is the ultimate test of unity—and the only thing standing between victory and death is trust."
