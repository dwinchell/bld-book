  ending-style-list:
    - name: "Action-Based Reflection"
      description: >
        Conclude the scene with a small, concrete action that mirrors the character's emotional state or transition. 
        The focus is on a deliberate physical movement or gesture that symbolizes inner change.
      example: >
        Luke let out a slow breath as he removed his battered armor, each unclasp feeling like 
        a gentle release of the tension he'd carried since morning.

    - name: "Emotional Introspection"
      description: >
        Close with the character's internal monologue or thought process, highlighting how 
        the scene’s events have shifted their mindset or feelings.
      example: >
        Raven stared at the dark corridor ahead, her heart pounding a little slower now, 
        realizing that she wasn't entirely certain she wanted to do this alone.

    - name: "Foreshadowing"
      description: >
        End by hinting at future challenges or developments. The scene may mention an 
        ominous detail or unresolved question to create anticipation.
      example: >
        As Luke picked up the strange medallion, he couldn’t shake the uneasy certainty 
        that this was just the beginning of something bigger.

    - name: "Symbolic Callback"
      description: >
        Wrap up by referencing a recurring symbol or motif, tying the scene’s outcome 
        to a broader theme in the story.
      example: >
        The flickering shadows around Raven’s feet seemed to dance with her heartbeat, 
        reminding her that darkness could protect as well as grant independence.

    - name: "Dialogue Tag"
      description: >
        Conclude on a key line of dialogue, leaving the audience with a strong statement 
        or question from a character, encapsulating the tension or resolution.
      example: >
        "Raven smirked, leaning casually against the dungeon wall. \"So, Mr. Dawnbringer, do you always play it this safe, or is today special?\""

    - name: "Setting Resonance"
      description: >
        Use the environment or setting to mirror the emotional tone. The final lines describe 
        the surroundings changing (or staying the same) to reflect the character’s internal state.
      example: >
        Thunder rumbled overhead, but the distant storm 
        felt less like a threat and more like a promise of renewal.

    - name: "Shift in Perspective"
      description: >
        Briefly shift the focus to another character’s internal thoughts or the larger world 
        to highlight how the scene’s events look from a different angle or context.
      example: >
        In the adjacent alley, a lone figure watched them depart, wondering if their fragile alliance 
        would survive what lay ahead.

    - name: "Cliffhanger"
      description: >
        End at the peak of tension, cutting off right before a significant discovery or conflict, 
        compelling the reader to move forward.
      example: >
        Raven reached for the door, unaware that behind it, something stirred—something far more dangerous 
        than any dungeon spawn she had faced before.

    - name: "Emotional Release"
      description: >
        Provide a cathartic moment of relief or resolution, letting the character briefly feel safe 
        or content before new challenges arise.
      example: >
        Luke sank onto the battered sofa, a shaky laugh escaping his lips—he was alive, 
        they were both alive, and for a second, that was enough.

    - name: "One-Line Echo"
      description: >
        End with a short, impactful sentence that echoes a previous line or theme, giving a sharp sense 
        of finality or resonance.
      example: >
        This time, she wouldn’t run; this time, she would face the darkness head-on.

    - name: "Humor Break"
      instructions: "Use humor breaks only when tonally appropriate to the scene"
      description: >
        End with a lighthearted or unexpected moment that provides comic relief or breaks the tension, adding a sense of levity.
      example: >
        As the silence stretched, Raven sighed and muttered, "Next time, I'm bringing snacks. This whole 'starving adventurer' thing isn't for me."
