    class-overview:
      name: "Night Dancer"
      description: >
        An agile, shadow-infused fighter who thrives on precision and grace, using deliberate defense
        and dynamic mobility to dominate the battlefield. The Night Dancer excels at disruption,
        threat generation, and precise resource management. While classified as a tank,
        her survival depends on skillfully mitigating damage through dodges, blocks, and counters,
        rather than absorbing hits directly.
      theme: >
        The Night Dancer’s abilities manifest as shadows, auras, and apparitions that darken the
        battlefield, symbolizing her independence, adaptability, and internal struggle. As she grows
        alongside her allies, these shadows come to represent teamwork and trust.
      resources:
        - flow:
            description: >
              The Night Dancer’s primary resource, generated through defensive mastery
              (dodging, blocking, and counters). Flow fuels powerful abilities that emphasize
              precision, mobility, and disruption.
            sensory_details: >
              Flow feels like a cool, tingling surge coursing through the Night Dancer’s body,
              heightening reflexes and awareness. It provides a seamless connection between her physical
              agility and shadow-infused power.
      mechanics:
        - "High mobility and precision-based play reward skillful execution of dodges and blocks."
        - "Generates Flow through defensive actions, encouraging a risk-reward playstyle."
        - "Balances vulnerability with powerful threat generation and crowd control."
      narrative-role:
        - "Represents Raven’s thrill-seeking nature and her struggle to trust others, as her shadows initially obscure Luke’s light."
        - "Highlights Raven’s mastery of tactics and her virtuoso-like combat style, emphasizing her daring and precision."
        - "As the story progresses, her shadow abilities symbolize her growing partnership with Luke, blending light and darkness into harmony."

        - light-and-darkness:
            symbolism: >
              The Night Dancer’s shadow-infused abilities symbolize her independence, adaptability,
              and mystery. Her connection to darkness reflects both her thrill-seeking nature and her
              difficulty in relying on others. As her relationship with Luke develops, her abilities
              evolve to blend seamlessly with his light, symbolizing their synergy.

        abilities:
          - "Luminous Bond": "Redirects a percentage of Raven’s incoming damage to Luke for 6 seconds, amplifying heals applied to him during this period."
          - "Sanctuary of Light": "An ultimate ability that creates a large healing aura, regenerates stamina/mana/Flow, and reduces incoming damage."
          - "Brilliant Mend": "Instantly restores a large amount of health to a single ally. Expensive and reserved for emergencies."
        narrative_example: |
          With a desperate motion, Luke extended his staff, golden light engulfing Raven as her staggered form straightened: [Healing: Major, Torso]. “That was close,” he muttered, already calculating their next move.

    narrative_integration:
      - emphasis_on-strategy: >
          Luke’s healing is rarely standalone; instead, it synergizes with his positional and utility abilities, requiring forethought and adaptability.
          This integration mirrors his personality—nurturing yet deliberate, always focused on maximizing the impact of his efforts.
      - example: |
          The faint glow of the circle beneath them flickered as Luke adjusted his stance, drawing energy to the staff. 
          “Stay within the light,” he instructed. The zone expanded slightly, healing Raven’s wounds while forcing the predators back.

  status_effects:
    description: >
      Status effects are temporary conditions that impact performance during combat or exploration. 
      They can impair movement, health, or resource generation, or provide temporary boosts. 
      Resolving or leveraging these effects requires strategic abilities, items, or environmental interactions. 
      Effects are visually represented on the HUD for clarity.
    narrative-role:
      description: >
        Status effects serve as both a storytelling and gameplay tool, enhancing tension, stakes, and the sense of strategy during encounters. 
        They reflect the dynamic challenges of dungeon diving while highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of characters like Luke and Raven.

      purposes:
        - "Reinforce stakes: Persistent or escalating effects like Poisoned or Shadow Corruption create urgency and consequences for failure."
        - "Showcase teamwork: Conditions like Frozen encourage characters to synergize their abilities to resolve challenges collaboratively."
        - "Emphasize character arcs: Specific effects mirror emotional or thematic struggles, such as Shadow Corruption symbolizing Raven’s internal battles."
        - "Create dynamic pacing: Status effects add variability to encounters, requiring the party to adapt their strategies mid-fight."
        - "Highlight abilities: Healing and utility skills become essential for resolving effects, reflecting Luke’s nurturing and proactive role."

      examples:
        - "Raven’s resilience and quick reactions allow her to fight through Exhaustion, showing her grit and determination."
        - "Luke’s light-based abilities provide critical moments of relief, countering Shadow Corruption and underscoring his protective nature."

  taunting:
    description: >
      Taunting in the world of *Bound in Light and Darkness* is a narrative-driven mechanic rooted in enemy psychology and instincts. 
      Rather than using a mechanical "threat" system, Raven’s taunt abilities leverage her boldness, shadow magic, and tactical acumen 
      to manipulate enemies into focusing their attention on her. Taunts are situational and depend on the type of enemy she faces, 
      creating opportunities for strategic play and narrative tension.

    narrative-focus: >
      Raven’s taunts highlight her charisma and confidence, using a mix of aggression, proximity, and clever manipulation to provoke 
      enemies. Her ability to anticipate and exploit enemy behavior reinforces her dynamic and daring personality while opening 
      tactical opportunities for Luke.

    taunt-rules:
      - "Instinct-driven enemies (e.g., beasts, basic dungeon mobs) respond to proximity, aggression, and environmental control."
      - "Intelligent enemies (e.g., humanoids, bosses) require psychological triggers, such as provoking their pride, anger, or frustration."
      - "Resistant enemies (e.g., automata, undead) may be immune or only partially affected, requiring alternate strategies to manage them."

    synergy:
      description: >
        Raven’s taunts create critical openings for Luke to reposition, heal, or establish area control without pressure. 
        Their teamwork shines when Raven uses her taunt abilities to keep enemies occupied while Luke executes his plans. 
        This dynamic emphasizes their complementary roles in battle.
      examples:
        - "Raven draws attention with Shadow’s Grasp, allowing Luke to cast Radiant Wall to protect their flank."
        - "Dancer’s Challenge isolates a boss, giving Luke time to heal or set up high-impact Light Charge abilities."

    examples:
      - name: Shadow’s Grasp
        scenario: >
          A pack of feral Shadow Predators surrounds Raven and Luke. Raven activates Shadow’s Grasp, shrouding the area in disorienting shadows. 
          The predators focus entirely on her, their confusion giving Luke the space to retreat and summon Radiant Wall to secure their position.
        narrative-role: >
          This showcases Raven’s ability to control chaotic battles and protect her allies through aggressive crowd management.

      - name: Dancer’s Challenge
        scenario: >
          Facing a cunning dungeon boss, Raven steps forward with a smirk. “You look like you need someone to put you in your place,” she taunts, 
          her shadowy aura flaring. The boss, enraged, focuses entirely on her, giving Luke precious seconds to heal and set up a Blazing Circle.
        narrative-role: >
          This emphasizes Raven’s ability to outwit powerful enemies, turning their aggression into a tactical advantage for the team.
