title: "Combat Training Arc"
description: >
  This file tracks Luke and Raven's progression from the time they decide to do the spire in No More Running to the time they are prepared to run it instinct.
  This is an arc with two layers - combat and emotional. The combat layer occurs primarily inside the dungeon and shows how their combat synergy evolves.
  The emotional layer occurs primarily outside the dungeon and shows how their emotional connection evolves. The two layers reinforce each other.
  Both layers are vehicles for the themes of Trust and Vulnerability, The Power of Partnership, and Independence vs Interdependence.
  The layers section below describes each layer in more detail. The progression section describes how both layers of evolve, chapter by chapter.
  The chapters in the progression section are tagged to show which layer they develop the most.


layers:
  - name: combat
    description: >
      This layer explores Luke and Raven’s progression from early misalignment to seamless combat synergy. 
      It focuses on how their fighting styles evolve to complement each other, reinforcing both their 
      partnership and individual growth. This arc is critical for building trust and preparing for the 
      Radiant Spire challenge.

    core-combat-philosophy:
      balance-of-styles:
        - "Raven leads dynamically, trusting her instincts and reflexes."
        - "Luke provides structure, ensuring flexibility while supporting her tempo."
        - "Raven must maintain the right pacing—too slow and she loses Flow, too fast and Luke can't keep up."
        - "True synergy isn’t about adapting to each other individually, but both adjusting within their strengths."
