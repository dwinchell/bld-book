  description: >
    Status effects are temporary conditions that impact performance during combat or exploration. 
    They can impair movement, health, or resource generation, or provide temporary boosts. 
    Resolving or leveraging these effects requires strategic abilities, items, or environmental interactions. 
    Effects are visually represented on the HUD for clarity.

    description: >
      Status effects serve as both a storytelling and gameplay tool, enhancing tension, stakes, and the sense of strategy during encounters. 
      They reflect the dynamic challenges of dungeon diving while highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of characters like Luke and Raven.
    purposes:
      - "Reinforce stakes: Persistent or escalating effects like Poisoned or Shadow Corruption create urgency and consequences for failure."
      - "Showcase teamwork: Conditions like Frozen encourage characters to synergize their abilities to resolve challenges collaboratively."
      - "Emphasize character arcs: Specific effects mirror emotional or thematic struggles, such as Shadow Corruption symbolizing Raven’s internal battles."
      - "Create dynamic pacing: Status effects add variability to encounters, requiring the party to adapt their strategies mid-fight."
      - "Highlight abilities: Healing and utility skills become essential for resolving effects, reflecting Luke’s nurturing and proactive role."
    examples:
      - "Raven’s resilience and quick reactions allow her to fight through Exhaustion, showing her grit and determination."
      - "Luke’s light-based abilities provide critical moments of relief, countering Shadow Corruption and underscoring his protective nature."
