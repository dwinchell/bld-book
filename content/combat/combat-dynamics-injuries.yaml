  injuries_and_healing:
    description: >
      Injuries and healing in *Bound in Light and Darkness* are represented
      through a combination of immersive prose and redacted tags that convey
      severity and location. This system ensures clear stakes and emotional weight
      without relying on explicit descriptions of physical harm.

    injury_categories:
      - name: Minor
        color: Yellow
        description: >
          Small impacts with limited effects. Typically results in slight stamina drain
          or minor inconvenience in combat.

      - name: Moderate
        color: Red
        description: >
          Noticeable injuries that affect combat capabilities, such as reduced movement
          speed or accuracy. Requires healing to restore optimal performance.

      - name: Major
        color: Dark Red
        description: >
          Significant injuries with serious consequences. Impairs critical functions like
          mobility or the ability to use certain skills. Prioritized for immediate healing.

      - name: Critical
        color: Black
        description: >
          Life-threatening or incapacitating damage. Requires urgent intervention to avoid
          catastrophic outcomes.

  ways-to-describe-injuries:
    - perspective: "Description of Character Actions"
      method: >
        In prose, injuries are usually described through emotional and sensory reactions, with graphic details replaced by tags. 
        Tags are embedded naturally within sentences to enhance immersion and narrative flow.
      example: |
        The predator’s claws grazed her side, sharp pain blossoming instantly as her HUD flickered: [Injury: Moderate, Torso]. Each step pulled at the wound, her movements losing some of their usual grace.

    - perspective: "HUD-Based Ragdoll Interface"
      method: >
        Injuries are visually represented on Luke's HUD as a color-coded ragdoll figure.
        Areas of the body are shaded based on severity: Yellow (Minor), Red (Moderate),
        Dark Red (Major), Black (Critical). This system provides clarity during combat.
      example: |
        The ragdoll figure on Luke’s HUD flickered, Raven’s leg glowing red. His jaw tightened as he adjusted his stance. She wouldn’t last long at this pace.

    - perspective: "HUD Notifications"
      method: >
        Critical injuries and status effects trigger text-based alerts on Luke’s HUD, providing immediate, actionable information.
      example: |
        Luke’s HUD flashed: **Raven: Major Injury (Torso). Movement impaired.**
