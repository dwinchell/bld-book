    - name: "Integrated Healing"
      resource_cost: "Varies based on ability (low to medium mana)."
      description: >
        Healing is woven into Luke’s abilities as secondary effects, rewarding strategic placement and multi-purpose usage.
        For example, abilities like "Blazing Circle" heal allies while damaging enemies, emphasizing Luke’s battlefield control and synergy.
      abilities:
        - "Blazing Circle": "Creates a zone of light that slightly heals allies within while dealing damage to enemies."
        - "Guiding Radiance": "Applies a HoT to an ally, enhanced when used inside Luke’s zones like Blazing Circle."

    - name: "Proactive Healing"
      resource_cost: "Low mana, high planning"
      description: >
        Shields, barriers, and buffs that mitigate damage or reduce injury severity before it occurs.
        These abilities reflect Luke’s protective instincts and strategic approach to combat, ensuring allies stay in the fight longer.
      abilities:
        - "Radiant Wall": "Creates a barrier that blocks projectiles and slows melee attackers who pass through."
        - "Aegis of Dawn": "Shields an ally, and if the shield breaks, it emits a small burst of healing."
      narrative_example: |
        A shimmering wall of light materialized between Raven and the charging beast, its momentum slowed as the barrier absorbed the brunt of the impact. Behind it, Raven smirked, unfazed by the attack.

    - name: "Critical Healing Moments"
      resource_cost: "High mana, cooldown-dependent"
      description: >
        Luke’s high-impact healing abilities are reserved for moments of crisis, when rapid intervention is needed to prevent a fight-ending injury.
        These abilities are often expensive but powerful, ensuring their usage is a tactical choice rather than a default action.
      abilities:
        - "Luminous Bond": "Redirects a percentage of Raven’s incoming damage to Luke for 6 seconds, amplifying heals applied to him during this period."
        - "Sanctuary of Light": "An ultimate ability that creates a large healing aura, regenerates stamina/mana/Flow, and reduces incoming damage."
        - "Brilliant Mend": "Instantly restores a large amount of health to a single ally. Expensive and reserved for emergencies."
      narrative_example: |
        With a desperate motion, Luke extended his staff, golden light engulfing Raven as her staggered form straightened: [Healing: Major, Torso]. “That was close,” he muttered, already calculating their next move.

  narrative_integration:
    - emphasis_on-strategy: >
        Luke’s healing is rarely standalone; instead, it synergizes with his positional and utility abilities, requiring forethought and adaptability.
        This integration mirrors his personality—nurturing yet deliberate, always focused on maximizing the impact of his efforts.
    - example: |
        The faint glow of the circle beneath them flickered as Luke adjusted his stance, drawing energy to the staff. 
        “Stay within the light,” he instructed. The zone expanded slightly, healing Raven’s wounds while forcing the predators back.

taunting:
  description: >
    Taunting in the world of *Bound in Light and Darkness* is a narrative-driven mechanic rooted in enemy psychology and instincts. 
    Rather than using a mechanical "threat" system, Raven’s taunt abilities leverage her boldness, shadow magic, and tactical acumen 
    to manipulate enemies into focusing their attention on her. Taunts are situational and depend on the type of enemy she faces, 
    creating opportunities for strategic play and narrative tension.

  narrative-focus: >
    Raven’s taunts highlight her charisma and confidence, using a mix of aggression, proximity, and clever manipulation to provoke 
    enemies. Her ability to anticipate and exploit enemy behavior reinforces her dynamic and daring personality while opening 
    tactical opportunities for Luke.
  taunt-rules:
    - "Instinct-driven enemies (e.g., beasts, basic dungeon mobs) respond to proximity, aggression, and environmental control."
    - "Intelligent enemies (e.g., humanoids, bosses) require psychological triggers, such as provoking their pride, anger, or frustration."
    - "Resistant enemies (e.g., automata, undead) may be immune or only partially affected, requiring alternate strategies to manage them."
  synergy:
    description: >
      Raven’s taunts create critical openings for Luke to reposition, heal, or establish area control without pressure. 
      Their teamwork shines when Raven uses her taunt abilities to keep enemies occupied while Luke executes his plans. 
      This dynamic emphasizes their complementary roles in battle.
    examples:
      - "Raven draws attention with Shadow’s Grasp, allowing Luke to cast Radiant Wall to protect their flank."
      - "Dancer’s Challenge isolates a boss, giving Luke time to heal or set up high-impact abilities."
  examples:
    - name: Shadow’s Grasp
      scenario: >
        A pack of feral Shadow Predators surrounds Raven and Luke. Raven activates Shadow’s Grasp, shrouding the area in disorienting shadows. 
        The predators focus entirely on her, their confusion giving Luke the space to retreat and summon Radiant Wall to secure their position.
      narrative-role: >
        This showcases Raven’s ability to control chaotic battles and protect her allies through aggressive crowd management.
    - name: Dancer’s Challenge
      scenario: >
        Facing a cunning dungeon boss, Raven steps forward with a smirk. “You look like you need someone to put you in your place,” she taunts, 
        her shadowy aura flaring. The boss, enraged, focuses entirely on her, giving Luke precious seconds to heal and set up a Blazing Circle.
      narrative-role: >
        This emphasizes Raven’s ability to outwit powerful enemies, turning their aggression into a tactical advantage for the team.
