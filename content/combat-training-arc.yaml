description: >
  This file tracks Luke and Raven’s progression from early misalignment to seamless combat synergy. 
  It focuses on how their fighting styles evolve to complement each other, reinforcing both their 
  partnership and individual growth. This arc is critical for building trust and preparing for the 
  Radiant Spire challenge.

core-combat-philosophy:
  balance-of-styles:
    - "Raven leads dynamically, trusting her instincts and reflexes."
    - "Luke provides structure, ensuring flexibility while supporting her tempo."
    - "Raven must maintain the right pacing—too slow and she loses Flow, too fast and Luke can't keep up."
    - "True synergy isn’t about adapting to each other individually, but both adjusting within their strengths."

progression:
  - chapter: "Back in the Field"
    key-misalignment:
      - "First real dungeon dive together since their fallout."
      - "They operate efficiently but without true synergy—familiar but not instinctive."
      - "Luke is cautious, analyzing Raven’s movements instead of fully committing."
      - "Raven tests boundaries but doesn’t push too hard, subconsciously waiting for Luke to set the rhythm."
    breakthrough:
      - "They recognize they can still function as a duo, but the deeper trust isn’t there yet."
      - "This dive **proves they can work together** again, but it also highlights that they have work to do."
    result: "A baseline for their partnership—functional but not seamless."

  - chapter: "Dungeon Challenge"
    key-misalignment:
      - "Raven hesitates, trying too hard to match Luke’s tactical rhythm."
      - "Luke second-guesses his defensive calls."
    breakthrough:
      - "Luke realizes he needs to trust Raven’s instincts instead of over-planning."
      - "Raven recognizes she has to stop second-guessing and just move naturally."
    result: "First glimpse of true synergy."

  - chapter: "Balancing Risk"
    key-misalignment:
      - "Luke overheals, disrupting Raven’s natural tempo."
    breakthrough:
      - "Raven teaches Luke to see health as a resource, not just a safety buffer."
    result: "They begin defining clear boundaries of intervention."

  - chapter: "Going Solo"
    key-misalignment:
      - "Luke hesitates too much when diving alone, making him inefficient."
    breakthrough:
      - "Luke learns to trust his own survival instincts, mirroring how Raven trusts him in a duo."
    result: "Luke gains confidence in taking risks."

  - chapter: "Audibles"
    key-misalignment:
      - "Verbal communication is slowing them down."
    breakthrough:
      - "They create structured callouts to refine real-time coordination."
    result: "A foundation for nonverbal synchronization."

  - chapter: "Through Fire and Frustration"
    key-misalignment:
      - "They aren’t fully syncing in early fights, leading to minor inefficiencies."
    breakthrough:
      - "A mid-dungeon sparring match forces them to reset and trust pure instinct."
    result: "First seamless fight—proof they’re improving."

  - chapter: "The Silent Fight"
    key-misalignment:
      - "No verbal coordination available."
    breakthrough:
      - "They rely entirely on instinct and rhythm—no second-guessing, just flow."
    result: "They prove they can fight as a single unit."

  - chapter: "Radiant Spire"
    key-misalignment:
      - "No misalignment. They’re ready."
    breakthrough:
      - "Their final test: no hesitation, no overcorrection—only trust."
