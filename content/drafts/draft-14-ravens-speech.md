## Chapter 14: Raven's Speech

### Scene 1: Handcuffs

Raven strode into the gala’s grand hall, her heeled boots clicking softly against the polished marble floors. Crystal chandeliers cast a soft glow over the elegantly dressed crowd, their murmurs blending with the faint notes of a string quartet. Her black dress hugged her frame, dramatic as ever, but tonight it was accessorized with something unusual: a bracelet on each wrist, one shimmering blue and the other silver.

She approached her mother, who stood near the edge of the room, poised with her usual grace. Elaine Blackwood’s silvery blonde hair was perfectly styled, her pastel gown a soft contrast to the darker tones around her. As Raven neared, Elaine’s sharp gray eyes landed on her wrists.

“Handcuffs?” Elaine asked dryly, arching a single eyebrow.

Raven grinned and struck a playful pose, crossing her wrists as if bound. “The only way you could get me to stop wearing black.” She twirled one bracelet dramatically. “Don’t they just scream compromise?”

Elaine’s expression softened into the faintest of smiles before slipping back to her usual composed demeanor. “I believe the bargain was blue and silver in exchange for bringing a plus-one. And yet,” she tilted her head slightly, “I’ve yet to see this supposed companion.”

“I fulfilled my end of the deal,” Raven replied, her grin unwavering. “Technically.”

Elaine’s gaze didn’t waver. “Speaking of your plus-one, I had a brief word with the Hargraves earlier. Julian mentioned meeting your ‘boyfriend’?” Her voice was calm, but the skepticism carried a sharper undertone, as if probing for a truth Raven hadn’t admitted even to herself.

Raven’s grin faltered for a split second before she leaned into the act. “A little white lie to keep Julian from getting... ideas.” She waved a hand dismissively. “You know how he is.”

“Do I?” Elaine’s tone remained light, but the way she studied Raven made her stomach tighten. “Raven, darling, I can’t help but wonder if there’s more to this ‘lie’ than you’re letting on. Perhaps even more than you realize.”

Raven rolled her eyes, deflecting with a breezy laugh. “You’re reading too much into it, Mom. It’s nothing.”

Elaine’s smile remained faint but knowing, but it slowly faded as her expression turned stern. “I had hoped you would take this event more seriously, Raven. It’s an important evening for the Foundation, and I can’t help but feel your... antics might be a distraction.”

The words landed harder than Raven expected, her grin fading completely. She glanced away, her gaze catching the glint of chandeliers reflected on the floor. “I’ll try to keep the distractions to a minimum,” she said lightly, but her voice lacked its usual edge.

Elaine’s demeanor softened just slightly. “If you’re done with your theatrics, perhaps you could take a moment to speak with some of the prospective donors. They’ve heard so much about you, and your presence would mean a great deal.”

Raven’s chest tightened, guilt creeping in alongside the familiar frustration. “Sure. I’ll... mingle.”

Elaine’s smile was faint but approving. She placed a hand briefly on Raven’s arm before stepping away to greet another guest, leaving Raven standing alone in the glow of the chandeliers. Her fingers toyed with the edge of the silver bracelet as she watched her mother blend seamlessly into the crowd.


### Scene 2: Osmium

Grant Blackwood stood at the edge of the gala floor, commanding the space with his usual charm and presence. His dark suit was tailored to perfection, a velvet lapel adding just a hint of flair. As Raven approached, she caught the familiar cadence of his voice, carrying easily over the murmur of the crowd.

"And here she is now!" Grant said, gesturing grandly as Raven stepped into earshot. "The fearless diver herself. Raven, I’d like you to meet Dr. Annabelle Haldane, Chair of the Department of Chemistry at Yale."

Dr. Keating extended a hand, her warm smile contrasting with the sharpness of her tailored gown. "It’s a pleasure, Raven. Your father has been telling me all about your exploits."

Raven shook her hand, feeling the firm grip of someone who commanded her field. "All good things, I hope."

"Of course, of course," Grant said, clapping a hand on Raven’s shoulder. "Did you know, Doctor, that my daughter is among the top divers in the country? She’s a real leader on those, uh, what do you call them, leaderboards?"

Dr. Keating’s eyes lit up with genuine interest. "I’m impressed. You know, Raven, we owe a lot to divers like you. One of your father’s previous galas resulted in a research grant we received in credits. It allowed us to purchase Osmium from the System—something we’d never have had access to otherwise."

"Osmium?" Raven tilted her head, intrigued despite herself.

Dr. Keating nodded. "Yes, it’s enabled groundbreaking research in organic chemistry. We’re exploring applications that could lead to new medical treatments. None of that would have been possible without the System’s unique resources."

Grant beamed, his hand still resting proudly on Raven’s shoulder. "And to think, Raven here is part of the reason the System thrives. Her dives, her victories—a family legacy in the making."

Raven couldn’t help the small smirk that tugged at her lips. "I’m not sure about all that, but it’s nice to hear the credits are making a difference."

Dr. Keating’s smile turned conspiratorial. "My daughter’s a diver too. Top Ranger NA, or so she says. I’m afraid that’s about as much as I understand of it."

Raven chuckled, caught between amusement and a flicker of competitiveness. "This week, I’m 'Top Dancer NA'," she said, her tone light but carrying a note of pride. She caught Grant’s pleased expression out of the corner of her eye, and for once, she didn’t mind.

Dr. Keating laughed. "You divers and your rankings. It’s like an entirely different world."

"It kind of is," Raven admitted, feeling a pang of guilt for the boast but also an unexpected thrill at seeing her father’s pride. "But it’s good to know the work we do in there has ripple effects out here."

Before the conversation could continue, a subtle shift in the room’s energy drew their attention. Elaine Blackwood had taken the stage, her composed figure standing gracefully at the podium. The hum of conversation faded into silence as all eyes turned to her.

Grant lowered his voice, leaning toward Raven. "Time to pay attention. Your mother’s about to steal the show."

Raven glanced at him, the corner of her mouth lifting in a small, reluctant smile, before shifting her focus to Elaine.

### Scene 3: Elaine's Speech

Elaine Blackwood stood at the podium, the epitome of poise and elegance. The room fell silent, the faint clinking of glasses fading as the crowd’s attention shifted entirely to her. The chandeliers above cast a soft light that seemed to frame her perfectly, her silvery blonde hair gleaming like a crown. She gripped the edges of the podium lightly, her movements measured, her gray eyes scanning the room with quiet authority.

“Good evening,” she began, her voice smooth and practiced, carrying effortlessly to every corner of the grand hall. “On behalf of the Blackwood Charitable Foundation, I want to thank you all for joining us tonight. Your support is what makes evenings like this not just possible, but meaningful.”

She paused, letting the words settle, her gaze briefly sweeping the crowd. “This past year has been one of immense progress for our foundation. Thanks to your generosity, we have funded over thirty community initiatives, including groundbreaking research partnerships and collaborative work with humanitarian relief agencies.”

Elaine’s tone shifted slightly, taking on a personal warmth. “I’d like to share one story in particular. Earlier this year, we provided credits to the United Nations World Food Program to assist a flood-stricken region in South Asia. Relief workers were able to use System terminals near the disaster site to purchase rations directly, eliminating the delays and costs associated with transporting supplies from other countries. This effort brought critical aid to thousands of people in need, far more quickly and efficiently than traditional methods could have achieved.”

A soft ripple of applause spread through the room. Elaine allowed it to build before raising a hand, quieting the crowd with a graceful gesture.

“Our next project, the one this gala was organized around, is designed to benefit the families of fallen divers. Divers make unique contributions to our society, enabling us to have the credits that programs like the World Food Program used to save lives. They do this at great personal risk, and many cannot obtain life insurance. This initiative will support the families of those who, in the truest sense, sacrifice themselves for our benefit.

Raven stood near the edge of the room, her arms loosely crossed as she listened. "Sacrifice" felt like a strong word. Most divers weren’t doing anything noble; they were chasing glory or just trying to make ends meet. Her thoughts shifted to Luke and how his sister depended on him for support. Before she could dwell further, Elaine’s voice cut through her reverie.

"This is what the Blackwood Charitable Foundation stands for," Elaine continued, her voice firm. "The belief that privilege comes with responsibility. That the resources we have access to should be used not just to elevate ourselves, but to uplift society as a whole. The System may offer us opportunities unlike anything humanity has seen before, but it’s what we choose to do with those opportunities that defines us."”

Raven stood near the edge of the room, her arms loosely crossed as she listened. Her mother’s words resonated in a way she hadn’t expected, a quiet weight settling in her chest. She glanced at Grant, who was nodding along, his pride evident in his every movement.

Elaine’s voice softened, taking on a more reflective tone. “For me, this is not just about numbers or achievements. It’s about legacy—about creating a future where the next generation can thrive. A future where the work we do today lays the foundation for something greater. And for that, we need each and every one of you. Your passion, your generosity, your belief in what we can accomplish together.”

The applause this time was louder, more sustained. Elaine smiled, a genuine warmth breaking through her composed exterior. “Thank you,” she said simply, stepping back from the podium as the crowd rose to their feet in appreciation.

Raven clapped along with the rest, her gaze lingering on her mother. For all the pressure and expectation that came with being a Blackwood, moments like this reminded her why her family’s work mattered. And why, despite everything, she couldn’t entirely resent it.

### Scene 4: An Impromptu Speech

Grant Blackwood’s voice boomed across the hall, rich with pride and infectious energy. “Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention for just a moment!” He stood near the front of the room, his hand raised dramatically to silence the murmurs of the crowd.

“I’d like to introduce someone very special,” he continued, his gaze sweeping the audience before landing on Raven. “A fearless diver, a trailblazer, and, as I’ve been informed, the top diver in North America. Oh, and did I mention? A rare solo diver at that. My daughter, Raven Blackwood!”

The applause swelled as Grant gestured for her to take the stage. Raven’s stomach churned at the unexpected spotlight, but there was no escaping now. She stepped forward, her heels clicking against the polished marble, a tight smile on her face. Her mind raced as she climbed onto the stage.

“Thanks, Dad,” Raven began, grabbing the microphone and laughing lightly. “Well, I definitely wasn’t ready for this, but if there’s one thing dives have taught me, it’s how to improvise.” The crowd chuckled warmly, and her shoulders relaxed a fraction.

“I do have to correct my dad on one small thing,” she added, her tone playful but firm. “I’m not actually the top diver in North America. I’m the top ‘Dancer,’ as in Night Dancer, my class. Diver slang can get a little confusing, so let’s forgive an enthusiastic father for mixing it up.” The room erupted in laughter, and she glanced at Grant. He grinned and gestured for her to continue, utterly unbothered. He was impossible to embarrass.

Raven’s smile softened as she continued, her thoughts racing. It felt wrong to take sole credit for her achievement. She wouldn’t have hit the top of the weekly leaderboard if it hadn’t been for Felforge Depths—and Luke.

“That said,” she went on, “I am known for being a solo diver. Until last week, that is. That’s when I met my new dive partner, Luke.” She pointed toward him in the crowd, and all heads turned. Luke waved awkwardly, his face reddening as he seemed to shrink into himself. The sight made her grin. “Luke is an exceptional healer,” she added. “He’s the one who keeps me patched up when I get a little... overzealous.”

The crowd laughed again, and Raven caught a movement out of the corner of her eye. Julian was glaring at her from across the room, his expression dark and suspicious. She felt a pang of unease but quickly masked it, thinking fast.

“He’s also the most supportive, collaborative partner a girl could ask for,” she added with a wink in Julian’s direction. That should be ambiguous enough to keep him guessing, she thought. The crowd laughed once more, and she realized, with growing horror, that she had accidentally convinced the entire audience that she and Luke were a couple. Someone clapped Luke on the back, and his shocked expression sent a flicker of guilt through her.

Clearing her throat, Raven shifted gears. “But I’m not here to talk about myself,” she said, her tone sobering. “On behalf of all divers, I want to thank everyone here. As you know, diving is a risky job. Many divers are hurt, and others quit—not because they lack the skill or courage, but because of the strain it places on their families.”

She paused, scanning the room. “Most divers can’t even get life insurance, so the program my mother described will go a long way to reassure some good people. It will help their families, who often bear the weight of these sacrifices.”

Her voice steadied, and she looked out at the crowd with a genuine smile. “Thank you, all of you, for your generous support of divers, the Foundation, and the work it does. We couldn’t do any of it without you.”

The audience broke into applause as Raven stepped back from the microphone, her heart pounding. She caught Grant’s beaming expression and Luke’s mix of mortification and reluctant amusement. It wasn’t perfect, but it was done.

### Scene 5: After the Speeches

Raven stepped off the stage, her pulse still racing from the applause. The crowd's polite smiles and soft claps echoed in her mind, their weight pressing down harder than she'd expected. She grabbed a glass of water from a passing tray and took a slow sip, letting the coolness steady her.

“You handled that well,” Luke’s voice came from just to her left, calm and grounded, cutting through the swirling noise in her head. She turned to find him standing a few feet away, his expression soft but steady. He was watching her like she was something solid and steady, not the chaos she currently felt.

“Handled it well?” she asked, arching a brow. “Pretty sure I just convinced everyone you’re my boyfriend.”

Luke’s lips curved into a small smile, one that reached his eyes. “I don’t think that’s the worst impression to leave. But if you keep calling me your boyfriend, people are going to start believing it.”

The words were teasing, but something about the way his smile faltered—just for a second—caught her off guard. The joke was light, but his tone carried an edge of strain. Almost as if he wasn’t quite as comfortable with it as he wanted to sound.

Raven took another sip of water to buy herself time. The room felt warmer than it should have, and the knot in her chest loosened slightly at his presence. She was still rattled from the impromptu speech, from the way her parents had managed to pull her into yet another spotlight she hadn’t asked for. But Luke—he was steady. Grounding. She’d never thought she’d appreciate having someone like that next to her, but here she was.

“I’ll keep that in mind,” she said, smirking just enough to make it clear she was brushing off the discomfort. “Guess I should stop before it goes to your head.”

Luke’s eyes softened further. He reached out briefly, his hand brushing her arm—just enough to steady her as another donor rushed past, nearly bumping her shoulder. “I think you’re doing fine. Better than fine, actually.”

The sincerity in his voice left her unbalanced in a way no chaotic battle ever could. Raven found herself holding his gaze a beat too long before looking away, her heart beating faster than she’d admit.

“Thanks,” she muttered. The word felt insufficient, but it was all she could manage without unraveling. She cleared her throat, forcing a casualness she didn’t feel. “I’ll have to practice my donor-pleasing skills. Next time, maybe I’ll keep it to thirty percent sarcasm.”

Luke chuckled softly, his laugh low and warm, and somehow it eased her more than the water had. “I’m not sure anyone would believe you if you didn’t have at least forty.”

“True,” she said, the corner of her mouth twitching upward.

The noise of the gala hummed around them, distant and unimportant for just a moment. Raven exhaled deeply, the tension from the stage bleeding out of her shoulders. Luke didn’t say anything else, but he didn’t need to. His presence spoke louder than words—steady, grounding, and quietly supportive in a way that surprised her more than she wanted to admit.

“Well,” she finally said, straightening. “I should probably get back out there. Can’t let all the glory-hungry guests monopolize my parents.”

Luke’s smile lingered, though it carried something softer now, less teasing and more thoughtful. “If you need backup, you know where to find me.”

Raven hesitated for just a second before nodding. “I’ll keep that in mind.”

As she walked back toward the crowd, she couldn’t help glancing over her shoulder. Luke was still there, watching her, his expression unreadable. For all the chaos and expectations swirling around her tonight, there was something about him that felt… solid. Something she might even be able to lean on, if she ever let herself.

She shook the thought away, stepping back into the noise and sparkle of the gala, her mixed feelings lingering as she disappeared into the crowd.
