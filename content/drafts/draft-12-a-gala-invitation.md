Chapter 12: A Gala Invitation

The Warden’s Rest was exactly what Luke needed after a dive—a place to let the lingering tension melt into the background hum of laughter and clinking glasses. Polished wood and steel accents reflected the warm overhead lighting, while the faint glow of a boss core, encased in glass on the back wall, gave the space an otherworldly edge. The scattered displays of shattered armor and ancient weapons, hung like trophies, added a layer of nostalgia that made it feel unmistakably like a diver’s sanctuary.

Luke stepped inside, his eyes scanning the crowd for a familiar face. Despite the bustle, his gaze settled quickly on Raven, seated at a corner booth. Her all-black ensemble—sleek, understated, and effortlessly stylish—stood out even in the eclectic mix of diver gear and casual wear. She had her hair down tonight, a rare look that softened her usually sharp demeanor. He paused briefly, caught off guard by how different she seemed outside of combat. She looked… approachable, almost.

“You planning to stand there all night, Sunshine, or are you actually joining me?” Raven’s voice, dry and teasing, cut through the noise, snapping him out of his thoughts. She smirked, waving him over with a casual flick of her hand.

Luke chuckled under his breath and made his way to the booth. “You know, most people use normal nicknames. Like their actual names.” He slid into the seat opposite her, the tension in his shoulders already starting to ease.

“Where’s the fun in that?” she replied, her eyes glinting with mischief. “Besides, it suits you. Always so steady and reliable… like the sun.”

He raised an eyebrow but didn’t argue. The nickname had grown on him—not that he’d ever admit it.

A server approached, setting down menus and taking their drink orders. Raven didn’t even glance at hers before ordering a dark ale. Luke, after a moment’s consideration, asked for the house lager. As the server walked away, Luke glanced around the room again, taking in the details. It was his second time at the Warden’s Rest, and the energy of the place was infectious. Groups of divers swapped exaggerated tales of glory at the bar, their laughter rising above the steady hum of conversation.

“Didn’t peg you as the type to hang out in places like this,” Luke said, leaning back slightly.

Raven arched a brow. “What, you think I crawl into a cave after every dive? I’m not a hermit.”

“I meant the whole… group-oriented vibe,” he clarified, gesturing toward the lively tables around them. “Figured a solo diver like you would avoid this kind of scene.”

She shrugged, a faint smile tugging at her lips. “Even lone wolves need to blow off steam. And this place has good beer and decent company. Besides,” she added, tilting her head toward a nearby table where a diver was gesturing animatedly, “you hear the best stories here. Makes it worth the occasional crowd.”

Luke followed her gaze and nodded. He could see the appeal—the camaraderie, the shared language of those who faced death for a living. It was a world of its own, and the Warden’s Rest was its heartbeat.

Their drinks arrived, and Raven raised her glass. “To surviving another day,” she said, her tone playful but edged with sincerity.

Luke clinked his glass against hers. “To surviving,” he echoed. The lager was cold and crisp, the perfect counterbalance to the warmth of the room.

As they settled into a comfortable rhythm of banter and drinks, Luke found himself watching Raven more closely. There was something about her here, in this space, that felt different. Less guarded. He couldn’t quite put his finger on it.

“Okay,” Raven started, her lips quirking into a wry smile. “Let’s hear it. What did I do this time?”

Luke raised an eyebrow. “What makes you think I have anything to critique?”

She tilted her head, giving him a pointed look. “Because you’re you, Sunshine. It’s part of your charm. The responsible healer, always ready with notes and suggestions.”

Luke chuckled. “Fine. Your Aegis of Shadow deployment during the forge hounds? Solid timing. But maybe next time, don’t stand so close to an active lava vent when you activate it.”

Raven laughed, a low, rich sound that turned a few heads from nearby tables. “I’ll add ‘lava avoidance’ to my list of things to improve.”

The server returned, setting a plate of fries and two dipping sauces between them. Raven immediately snatched a fry, pointing it at him like a sword before popping it into her mouth.

“You’re a perfectionist, you know that?” she said, her tone light but laced with something almost resembling fondness. “Always worrying about every little detail.”

“Someone has to,” he replied, grabbing a fry of his own. “Especially when my dive partner thinks ‘plan’ is a dirty word.”

Raven rolled her eyes. “I plan! I just leave room for… improvisation.”

“Right. Improvisation,” Luke said dryly. “That’s what we’re calling it now?”

Her laughter bubbled up again, and Luke found himself relaxing even further. Despite their differences, there was an ease to their conversations that felt… natural. They balanced each other in a way he was still getting used to, but it worked.

A comfortable pause followed as they finished their fries, the hum of the Warden’s Rest providing a soothing backdrop. Then Raven leaned back, her sharp grin cutting through the warm buzz of the room.

“So, Sunshine,” she began, an edge of mischief in her voice, “there’s this little event coming up. High fashion, good food, probably more expensive wine than I’ve ever cared to taste. You’re coming with me.”

Luke blinked, caught off guard. “I’m… what?”

“You heard me,” she said, her tone as casual as if she were inviting him to a training session. “It’s a gala. My family hosts it every year, and trust me, it’s more fun than it sounds. Think of it as a different kind of dive.”

Luke hesitated, his fingers tightening around his glass. “I’m not exactly… the gala type. You sure you’re asking the right person?”

“Who else would I ask?” she shot back, her tone light but pointed. “My options are limited to people who can keep up with me, and you, Sunshine, have proven yourself capable.”

“Raven, I don’t even own a suit,” he said, hoping the practical obstacle would put an end to this ridiculous idea.

“Not a problem,” she said breezily, waving her hand as if brushing the concern away. “We’ll get you one. Think of it as armor for a different kind of battlefield.”

He frowned. “I’m not letting you spend that kind of money on me.”

Her grin softened slightly, and she leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table. “It’s not about the money, Luke. It’s about the company. And besides,” she added with a playful smirk, “you’d look good in a tux.”

Luke’s mind raced, searching for an excuse that would sound reasonable. But Raven wasn’t giving him an out. Her confidence was unshakable, her tone playful yet sincere. And as much as he wanted to resist, part of him couldn’t help but feel… curious.

“Let me think about it,” he said finally, his voice quiet but firm.

Raven tilted her head, studying him for a moment before nodding. “Alright. But don’t take too long. They’re finalizing seating arrangements tomorrow.”

“Seating arrangements?” he asked, raising an eyebrow.

She smirked, leaning back in her seat again. “I’ll take that as a maybe. Let me know soon, Sunshine.”

Luke sighed, watching as she turned her attention to the rest of her drink. He’d managed to stall her, but only just. The thought of stepping into her world, so far removed from anything he’d ever known, left him uneasy. And yet… there was a pull he couldn’t quite ignore.

For now, he could think about it later. But deep down, he already knew his answer.

That night, Luke lay in bed, staring up at the faint lines of moonlight streaking across the ceiling. The city’s muffled sounds filtered through the window, but his thoughts were louder. He couldn’t shake the image of Raven—her sharp grin softening, the mix of mischief and sincerity in her eyes as she invited him.

A gala. It was worlds away from dungeons and danger, from the life he knew. He didn’t belong there. But Raven… she’d asked him. And that meant something.

Finally, he reached over to his nightstand and opened his HUD. The message he composed was simple, deliberate.

Fine. I’ll go.

He hesitated, his thumb hovering over the send button. Then, with a small exhale, he tapped it.

His HUD pinged almost immediately with Raven’s reply:

Knew you’d come around, Sunshine. 🌑 Tux shopping tomorrow. Non-negotiable.

Luke stared at the message, a faint smile tugging at his lips. He let out a slow breath, and the pull of sleep didn’t seem so far away.
