## Chapter 12: The Gala

Luke stepped out of the cab, adjusting the unfamiliar weight of the tuxedo jacket on his shoulders. The crisp evening air carried a faint chill, but it wasn’t enough to distract him from the growing unease knotting his stomach. Ahead of him loomed the grand entrance of the gala venue, a sprawling estate lit with golden light that spilled from tall windows. Soft strains of classical music drifted through the open doors, blending with the murmur of elegantly dressed attendees mingling just inside.

He hesitated at the edge of the red carpet, his polished shoes feeling out of place on its plush surface. This wasn’t his world. He could handle the chaos of a dungeon, the unpredictable rhythm of battle, but this—the gleaming chandeliers, the effortless grace of the crowd—left him feeling exposed.

“Alright, you’re here. No turning back now,” he muttered under his breath, squaring his shoulders and stepping forward. The tuxedo—rented, of course—felt stiff and awkward, the collar brushing uncomfortably against his neck. His hand moved instinctively to his wrist, brushing against the cufflink Raven had insisted he wear. “You’ll look fine,” she’d said with a teasing smile. “Just don’t scowl too much.”

Inside, the grandeur of the hall hit him like a wave. Polished marble floors gleamed beneath the glow of opulent chandeliers, their light scattering across the room like fragments of starlight. Guests moved in fluid patterns, their laughter and conversation creating a low, melodic hum. The clink of crystal glasses punctuated the air, accompanied by the occasional burst of polite laughter.

Luke scanned the room, his discomfort growing as his gaze darted over the crowd. Everyone here seemed so at ease, their movements effortless, their smiles practiced. He tugged at his collar again, forcing himself to take another step inside.

He couldn’t spot Raven immediately, and for a brief, absurd moment, he considered slipping back out. But then the murmur of the crowd shifted, subtle yet noticeable, drawing his attention to the staircase at the far end of the hall. There she was.

Raven descended with a confidence that commanded attention. She wore a sleek black gown that hugged her form, the fabric shimmering faintly under the chandelier’s glow. Her raven-black hair framed her face, cascading down her back in effortless waves. She moved with a grace that was almost predatory, her sharp gaze sweeping the room as though she were assessing a battlefield.

Luke’s breath hitched for a moment. He’d seen her confidence countless times in the dungeon, the way she wielded her shadow magic with precision and poise. But here, in this setting, it was different. Striking. Unshakable.

She caught sight of him then, her lips curving into a small, knowing smile as she changed course to head his way. The crowd seemed to part around her, their gazes following her just as his had.

“You clean up well, Sunshine,” she said as she reached him, her voice low enough to be heard only by him. The teasing lilt was unmistakable, but there was warmth beneath it. Her eyes flicked over his tuxedo, the corners of her mouth quirking up further. “Not bad at all.”

“Thanks,” he managed, his voice a touch gruff. “You look... great.”

She arched an eyebrow, clearly amused by his awkward delivery, but she didn’t press. Instead, she linked her arm through his, her touch light yet steady. “Come on,” she said, guiding him further into the hall. “Let’s survive this together.”

Luke allowed himself a small smile, the tension in his shoulders easing just slightly. He didn’t belong here, not really. But with Raven by his side, maybe—just maybe—he could fake it long enough to get through the night.

Raven shifted her weight, the polished heels of her shoes pinching slightly as she maneuvered through the crowd. She offered polite smiles and exchanged brief pleasantries with the guests who approached her. It was a performance she knew well—graceful, confident, just distant enough to discourage anything deeper than small talk. The warm glow of sconces lined the walls, their light glinting off crystal glasses and casting long shadows across the grand hall.

She paused near a table adorned with an elaborate ice sculpture, pretending to admire it while discreetly scanning the room. The evening had been bearable so far, but she knew the real challenges at these events often came from conversations rather than combat.

Her instincts proved correct when a smooth, familiar voice sounded behind her. “Raven Blackwood. Always a pleasure to see you gracing these events.”

She turned to find Maxwell Hawthorne, heir to one of the city’s most influential families, standing uncomfortably close. He held a glass of champagne in one hand, the other tucked casually into the pocket of his tailored suit. His smile was wide and polished, like everything about him.

“Maxwell,” she said evenly, forcing a polite smile. “It’s been a while.”

“Too long,” he replied, his gaze lingering just a little too long. “You’ve been keeping busy, I hear. Dungeon diving, was it? Quite the… unconventional choice for someone of your stature.”

Raven’s jaw tightened, but she maintained her composure. “I find it fulfilling.”

“I’m sure,” he said, his tone dripping with condescension. “But surely you’ve considered returning to a more traditional role. Someone with your talents could accomplish so much in… safer endeavors.”

She resisted the urge to roll her eyes. “I’ll keep that in mind,” she said coolly, hoping he’d take the hint and move on. Instead, he stepped closer, his smile unwavering.

“You know, Raven,” Maxwell continued, his voice dropping to a more intimate tone, “I’ve always admired your… independence. But even the most capable individuals benefit from strong alliances.”

Raven’s forced smile thinned. She’d been through this song and dance before. Maxwell’s compliments were always layered with implications, his “advice” an excuse to needle his way into her life. She searched for an exit, her eyes scanning the room for anyone who might provide a convenient distraction.

Then she saw him—Luke, standing near the edge of the crowd. His awkward stance and the way he occasionally tugged at his collar stood out amidst the polished confidence of the other guests. He looked about as comfortable as she felt.

An idea sparked.

“Maxwell,” she said, her tone shifting to one of feigned delight. “I’d love to chat more, but I believe my date is looking for me.”

“Your date?” Maxwell repeated, his brows lifting in surprise.

“Yes,” she said, already moving past him. “Excuse me.”

She wove her way through the crowd, making a beeline for Luke. As she approached, she reached out to lightly tap his arm, drawing his attention. He turned, his expression shifting from discomfort to confusion as he registered her sudden appearance.

“Play along,” she murmured under her breath, slipping her arm through his. “You’re my boyfriend for the next five minutes.”

Luke blinked. “What?”

Before he could protest further, she guided him back toward Maxwell, her grip firm but not forceful. Her smile returned, bright and sharp, as they stopped in front of the heir.

“Maxwell, this is Luke,” she said smoothly. “My partner.”

Maxwell’s surprise was evident, though he quickly masked it with a polite nod. “Ah, I see. A pleasure to meet you, Luke.”

Luke hesitated for a fraction of a second before offering his hand. “Likewise,” he said, his tone steady despite the bewilderment in his eyes.

“Well, I wouldn’t want to interrupt your evening,” Maxwell said, his smile tight. “Enjoy the gala.”

“We will,” Raven replied with a pointed smile. Maxwell lingered for a moment longer before retreating into the crowd.

As soon as he was out of earshot, Raven let out a quiet sigh of relief and released Luke’s arm. “Thanks for that,” she said, glancing up at him.

Luke gave her a wry look. “You’re welcome. I think. Want to explain what just happened?”

She shrugged, a hint of mischief in her eyes. “Just dealing with a persistent problem. You handled it well, Sunshine.”

Luke shook his head, but a small smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. “Glad I could help.”

Luke followed Raven as she led him to a quieter corner of the hall, his mind still reeling from the sudden role he’d been thrust into. Her grip on his arm was steady but light, and he noticed how she carried herself with an effortless confidence despite the tension in her shoulders. She slowed once they were out of earshot of the crowd, turning to face him with a small, apologetic smile.

“Thanks for playing along,” Raven said, releasing his arm. “I’ll make it up to you.”

Luke crossed his arms, his brow furrowing slightly. “So, we’re doing pretend-boyfriend now? Is that a regular part of your gala strategy?”

Raven let out a soft laugh, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Not exactly. But Maxwell doesn’t take hints well, and I figured you’d prefer stepping in over watching me deal with him for the rest of the night.”

“Can’t argue with that,” Luke admitted, though his voice carried a trace of bemusement. “He didn’t seem thrilled to meet me.”

“Maxwell doesn’t like competition,” she said with a smirk. “Even fake competition.”

Luke’s lips twitched, almost forming a smile. He glanced back at the crowd, where Maxwell had already disappeared among the other guests. “Well, I hope my performance was convincing enough.”

“You did great,” Raven said, her tone lighter now. “Though next time, maybe work on loosening up a bit. The whole ‘staring like a deer in headlights’ thing might’ve given us away.”

“Noted,” Luke said dryly. “But I think you’ve got the theatrics covered.”

She tilted her head, studying him for a moment. “You’re not as out of place here as you think, you know.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Pretty sure the tuxedo’s doing most of the work.”

“No,” she said, her voice softening. “You’ve got this... grounded presence. It stands out here, but not in a bad way. People notice it.”

Luke blinked, caught off guard by the sincerity in her tone. He wasn’t used to being the focus of compliments, let alone ones that felt this genuine. “Thanks,” he said after a pause, the word coming out quieter than he intended.

Raven shrugged, her usual smirk returning. “Don’t let it go to your head, Sunshine.”

He chuckled, shaking his head. “Too late.”

They fell into a comfortable silence for a moment, the distant hum of conversation and the soft strains of the orchestra filling the space between them. Luke glanced at Raven, noticing the faint tension still lingering in her posture.

“You alright?” he asked, his voice low.

Her gaze flicked to his, and for a second, she seemed caught off guard by the question. Then she nodded, her expression easing. “Yeah. Just... these events aren’t really my scene either.”

“Could’ve fooled me,” he said, gesturing to the elegance she seemed to wear like armor.

“It’s all smoke and mirrors,” she replied with a wry smile. “You get good at playing a part when you’ve had years of practice.”

Luke nodded, understanding more than he wanted to admit. “Guess we’ve got that in common.”

Raven’s smile softened, and for a brief moment, the air between them felt lighter, more open. She reached out, giving his arm a light squeeze. “Thanks for having my back tonight. Even if it meant improvising a little.”

“Anytime,” he said, his voice steady. And he meant it.

The crisp night air brushed against Raven’s skin as she stepped out onto the balcony, her heels clicking softly against the stone. The city stretched out before her, a sea of glittering lights and muted colors, its hum barely audible over the muffled music and chatter from the gala inside. She exhaled slowly, the tension in her shoulders easing slightly as she leaned against the railing.

The sound of the door creaking open behind her made her glance over her shoulder. Luke stepped out, his movements hesitant, like he wasn’t sure he belonged in this space. His gaze swept over the cityscape, and for a moment, Raven wondered what he thought of it. He always seemed so grounded, so steady, but the way his hands slid into his pockets suggested he felt just as out of place as she did.

“Needed a break?” he asked, his voice low and even.

Raven turned back to the view, letting the cool breeze settle her nerves. “Something like that. These events can get… stifling.”

She felt him move closer, not too close, but enough that his presence was noticeable. It was grounding in a way she hadn’t expected. “I can see that,” he said after a pause. “Seems like a lot of pressure.”

She let out a quiet laugh, her fingers tapping lightly against the railing. “You have no idea. The polished smiles, the expectations… it’s all just one big performance.”

“You make it look easy,” he said. There was no hint of flattery in his tone, just an honest observation.

Raven huffed softly. “It’s not. You learn to fake it, that’s all.” She glanced at him, half expecting to see judgment in his expression, but his steady gaze met hers, calm and unassuming.

“I see past it,” he said simply.

Her breath caught for a moment, his words cutting through the pretense she usually wore like armor. She studied his face, searching for any sign of insincerity, but found none. For once, she let the vulnerability linger instead of brushing it off.

“Thanks, Sunshine,” she said, her voice lighter now. She tilted her head, a smirk playing at her lips. “But that doesn’t get you off the hook for earlier.”

Luke’s chuckle was soft, but it warmed the cool air around them. “Didn’t think it would.”

Silence settled between them, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. Raven let herself focus on the distant hum of the city, her mind drifting. The weight of the evening still lingered, but it felt lighter with Luke standing there. She tapped her nails against the railing, the faint rhythm filling the quiet.

“You handled Maxwell pretty well,” she said eventually, breaking the stillness. Her tone was casual, but the memory of the heir’s smirk still grated on her nerves. “Most people would’ve folded.”

“I was close,” Luke admitted, a small grin tugging at the corner of his mouth. “But you seemed like you had it under control.”

Raven’s lips twitched into a smile. “Control’s an illusion,” she said, her voice quieter now. “You think you have it, but then something shifts, and you’re just… improvising.”

Luke’s head tilted slightly, his thoughtful expression making her feel like he was actually listening—not just hearing her, but understanding. “Sounds familiar,” he said. “It’s kind of like diving, isn’t it? You can plan all you want, but sometimes you’ve just got to trust your instincts and your team.”

Raven nodded, a genuine smile softening her features. “Exactly. Though I’m not used to having a team.”

“You do now,” he said, his voice steady but quiet, like he didn’t want to overstep.

Something in his tone made her turn to face him fully. His expression was open, unguarded in a way that caught her off guard. For a moment, she hesitated, unsure of what to say. Then she smiled, a rare, almost shy curve of her lips. “Yeah,” she said softly. “I guess I do.”

The door creaked open again, and Raven glanced back as a server stepped onto the balcony, balancing a tray of champagne flutes. The interruption broke the moment, and she waved the server off with a polite nod. Once they were alone again, she turned to Luke with a smirk.

“Guess we should get back before people start talking,” she said, the teasing edge returning to her voice.

Luke shrugged, his expression relaxed. “Let them talk,” he said, but he still stepped toward the door. “Ready?”

“As I’ll ever be,” Raven replied, following him inside. But as the noise and light of the gala enveloped them once more, she couldn’t shake the feeling that something between them had shifted. For once, the thought didn’t bother her.

Luke stood near the edge of the dance floor, feeling like an anchor amidst the swirling tide of elegant couples gliding across the polished wood. The music shifted to a slow waltz, its lilting melody filling the room and drawing even more people to the floor. He adjusted his cufflink, a small, nervous habit that did nothing to dispel the feeling that he didn’t belong here. He scanned the room instinctively, his gaze landing on Raven as she approached.

Her black gown shimmered faintly under the chandelier’s golden glow, and there was something in her expression—mischief, maybe, or determination—that immediately set him on edge. She stopped in front of him, tilting her head with a playful smile.

“Come on, Sunshine,” she said, extending a hand. “One dance won’t kill you.”

Luke’s brows knit together. “I’m pretty sure it might.”

Her grin widened, and she grabbed his hand before he could protest further. “That’s the spirit.”

Before he knew it, she was leading him onto the dance floor, weaving them through the other couples with effortless grace. Luke’s steps felt clumsy at first, his movements stiff and deliberate as he tried to mimic what he’d seen. Raven’s hand rested lightly on his shoulder, and her other hand guided his in a way that felt far more natural than he expected.

“Relax,” she said, her voice soft but teasing. “You’re not defusing a trap. Just follow my lead.”

“Easier said than done,” he muttered, though he tried to loosen his posture. The warmth of her hand in his and the rhythm of the music helped, and after a few moments, he found himself falling into the steps more easily.

“See? You’re a natural,” Raven said, her tone light but sincere.

Luke gave her a skeptical look, but the hint of amusement in his expression betrayed his growing comfort. “I wouldn’t go that far.”

They moved together through the soft swell of the music, and for the first time that evening, Luke felt like the noise of the gala faded into the background. The closeness of their steps, the way Raven’s gaze held his with that mix of playfulness and something unspoken—it was disarming in a way he hadn’t expected.

“Thanks for coming tonight,” she said suddenly, her voice quieter now. The teasing edge had softened, replaced by something almost thoughtful.

Luke hesitated, his eyes flicking to hers. “You didn’t really give me a choice,” he said, though his tone was warm, almost teasing.

She laughed softly, the sound low and genuine. “Fair. But you handled it better than most would.”

He shrugged, his grip on her hand tightening just slightly as they turned. “I guess I’ve had practice. Dungeons teach you how to adapt.”

“Still,” she said, her gaze steady. “You’ve got more patience than I deserve sometimes.”

Luke blinked, the words catching him off guard. He opened his mouth to respond, but the song began to wind down, and Raven pulled back slightly, her smirk returning as if to deflect the moment.

“Not bad, Sunshine,” she said, stepping away but leaving her hand in his for a moment longer than necessary. “Maybe there’s hope for you yet.”

“High praise,” Luke said dryly, though the faint smile tugging at his lips betrayed him. He glanced around, suddenly aware of the room again as the applause for the orchestra rippled through the crowd.

Raven tilted her head toward the exit, a silent suggestion that they move somewhere quieter. Luke nodded, following her lead. As they wove their way off the dance floor, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something unspoken had passed between them during those few minutes—something he wasn’t quite ready to name but couldn’t ignore.
