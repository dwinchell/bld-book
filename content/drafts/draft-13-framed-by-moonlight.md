## Chapter: Framed by Moonlight

### Scene: Arrival at the Gala

Luke stepped out of the cab and onto the polished stone driveway of the Blackwood estate, his shoes crunching faintly against the light scattering of gravel. He adjusted his rented tuxedo, tugging at the cuffs as if that might help him blend into the opulence around him. He wasn’t used to this—the grandeur, the elegance, the sheer weight of wealth that draped over everything like the chandeliers visible even from the front doors. 

He glanced up at the imposing mansion before him, its tall windows glowing with warm light that spilled out into the crisp night. The muffled hum of classical music and distant chatter floated on the air, mingling with the soft clink of crystal glasses. Luke swallowed hard. 

“Just a night,” he muttered under his breath, steeling himself. He was here for Raven, and Raven alone. 

The grand hall was even more overwhelming than he’d expected. Gleaming marble floors reflected the golden light of chandeliers that looked like they could pay off his sister’s college tuition ten times over. Men and women moved gracefully through the space, clad in tailored suits and flowing gowns, their laughter and murmured conversations underscoring the steady rhythm of the live string quartet in the corner. 

Luke hesitated at the entrance, hovering near the edge of the crowd. Every part of him felt out of place, a smudge of practicality in a world of polish and shine. He adjusted his tie again, an old habit he didn’t even realize he was doing. His fingers itched for the familiar grip of his staff, the weight of his leather armor. He wasn’t meant for this kind of battlefield.

And then he saw her.

Raven entered the room like a storm wrapped in silk. Her gown, sleek and black, clung to her figure with elegant precision. Her raven-black hair was swept into an elaborate style, strands framing her face in a way that seemed effortlessly perfect. For a moment, the crowd seemed to shift around her, parting just enough to give her a path that led directly into the center of the room.

Luke’s breath hitched, his discomfort momentarily forgotten. Raven’s confidence—or at least the image of it—radiated outward like the shadowed energy she wielded in the dungeon. She carried herself like she belonged here, even if he knew from their conversations that she hated events like these. The contrast between her poise and the vulnerability he’d seen in private moments only made her more striking.

As if sensing his gaze, Raven turned, her dark eyes locking onto his from across the hall. Her lips curled into a small, knowing smile—a lifeline tossed into the sea of his awkwardness. She raised an eyebrow, a silent invitation that said, *Come on, Sunshine. Don’t just stand there.*

Luke let out a breath and started forward, weaving through the crowd with practiced ease. He was used to maneuvering through chaos; this just required a different kind of focus. By the time he reached her, she’d stepped away from the throng, her expression shifting into something softer, almost amused.

“You clean up well,” Raven said, her tone light but her gaze scanning him like she was cataloging every detail. 

“Thanks,” Luke replied, his voice a touch quieter than usual. He adjusted his tie again, and Raven’s smile widened.

“Relax. You’re making me look bad with all this fidgeting,” she teased, though there was a note of reassurance beneath the words. “Come on. Let’s get a drink. You’re going to need one.”

Luke nodded, letting her take the lead as they moved toward the bar. As they walked, he couldn’t help but notice the way heads turned to follow her—and, to his surprise, him as well. For the first time since arriving, he felt a flicker of something other than discomfort. Pride, maybe. Or gratitude. 

Either way, he wasn’t alone in this, and that made all the difference.

### Scene: Pretend Boyfriend

Luke barely had time to sip his drink before Raven’s fingers curled around his arm, her grip light but urgent. “I need your help,” she said under her breath, her voice carrying an edge of tension.

He blinked at her, confused. “What?”

“Just go with it.” Raven’s dark eyes darted past him toward a tall, sharply dressed man closing in on them with a confident swagger. She sighed, her lips tightening into a polite but strained smile. “Julian doesn’t understand boundaries. Play along.”

Luke opened his mouth to ask for clarification, but before he could, Raven slid her arm through his and leaned into him with practiced ease. Her presence was a sudden weight against his side, a warm, grounding contrast to the cool detachment she usually carried.

“Ah, Raven,” Julian said as he approached, his voice dripping with charm that somehow felt more like oil. “I was hoping to catch you tonight. Care to share a dance?”

Luke felt a pang of something sharp and unfamiliar—jealousy. The unexpected sensation hit him like a spark of static, momentarily knocking him off balance. He didn’t understand it, and he didn’t have time to dwell on it.

Raven’s grip on Luke’s arm tightened. “Actually, I’m here with someone,” she said smoothly, tilting her head toward Luke. “My boyfriend.”

Luke froze, his brain scrambling to catch up. Boyfriend? The word hung in the air like an unexpected grenade. But Raven’s hand on his arm was steady, and her eyes flicked up to meet his, silently pleading for his cooperation.

“That’s right,” Luke said, his voice a little too loud at first before he cleared his throat. He slipped his free hand around Raven’s waist, his movements stiff but resolute. “We were just about to head back to the bar. Nice seeing you, though.”

Julian’s charming smile faltered for the briefest moment, his eyes narrowing as they flicked between Luke and Raven. He recovered quickly, his expression sliding back into something more polite but no less predatory. “I see. Well, enjoy your evening, Raven. And… nice to meet you.”

Luke didn’t miss the edge in Julian’s voice as he walked away, his shoulders stiff with the frustration of defeat.

“Thanks for that,” Raven murmured, relaxing slightly against him but not stepping away. Her tone was light, but there was a thread of genuine gratitude woven into it.

Luke looked down at her, still trying to process what had just happened. “You… could’ve warned me.”

Raven finally stepped back, her smirk returning in full force. “Where’s the fun in that? Besides,” she added, adjusting the strap of her gown as if nothing had happened, “you did great, Sunshine. Almost convincing.”

“Almost?” he echoed, raising an eyebrow.

“Don’t worry, I’ll give you a solid seven out of ten. Maybe eight.”

Luke shook his head, a reluctant smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “Glad I could help.”

Raven’s expression softened slightly, and for a moment, she looked at him like she was about to say something more. But then the noise of the gala pressed in around them again, and she stepped back, her usual sharpness reasserting itself.

“Come on,” she said, gesturing toward the bar. “You’ve earned another drink.”

As they moved through the crowd, Luke couldn’t shake the warmth of her hand on his arm or the way her presence had felt so easy and natural against him. For all the tension of the moment, he found himself feeling something else entirely: pride—and maybe just a little exhilaration.

### Scene: On the Balcony

The gala’s noise faded as Luke stepped out onto the balcony, the cool night air washing over him like a balm. He loosened his tie and leaned on the stone railing, grateful for the reprieve from the press of bodies and clinking glasses inside.

His mind churned with fragments of the evening—the sharp twinge of jealousy he’d felt when the other man had approached Raven, the unexpected protectiveness that had flared in him when she leaned on his arm. It wasn’t just the tension of the moment; it was the exhilaration that followed as they walked toward the bar together, her presence balancing him, keeping him from feeling completely out of place. He had excused himself after their drinks, needing air to clear his head and untangle the confusing knot of emotions she stirred in him.

He heard the soft click of heels behind him and turned to see Raven stepping out of the shadows, her gown a ripple of black silk in the moonlight. She moved with her usual grace, but there was something quieter about her now, her sharp edges softened by the stillness of the night. For a moment, she didn’t speak, her gaze sweeping across the sprawling cityscape below.

“Needed some air too?” Luke asked, his voice low, almost hesitant.

Raven’s lips twitched into a faint smile as she joined him at the railing. “Something like that.” She tilted her head back, her dark eyes reflecting the moonlight. “It’s… a lot in there.”

“Yeah.” Luke nodded, glancing back toward the glowing windows of the gala hall. “Not really my scene.”

“Mine either,” Raven admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. She leaned forward, resting her arms on the railing, the tension in her shoulders easing slightly. “But sometimes you’ve got to show up anyway.”

Luke studied her profile, the way the moonlight traced the curve of her cheek and the line of her jaw. The sight of her standing there, the moon behind her, cast her in an almost otherworldly glow. She looked ethereal, untouchable, and yet so utterly real in that moment that it stole his breath. His chest tightened as he realized the truth that had been building all evening—he was falling for her.

“Is it always like this?” he asked, his voice quieter now, his gaze lingering on her face. “The… people, the expectations?”

Raven let out a soft laugh, though there was little humor in it. “Always. Everyone’s watching, waiting for you to say or do the wrong thing. Pretend all you want, but they’ll still judge you.”

Luke frowned, his hands curling against the cool stone. “That doesn’t seem fair.”

“It’s not,” she said simply, turning to face him. Her gaze lingered on his face, searching. “But it’s how it works. You either learn to play the game or you don’t get invited back.”

“I’m guessing you’d rather skip the invite?”

Her smile widened, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Most of the time. But tonight…” She hesitated, her fingers brushing the necklace at her throat. “Good to have my dive partner watching my back tonight.”

The words hung in the air between them, heavier than Luke expected. He looked at her, the guarded expression she so often wore slipping just enough to show the vulnerability beneath. Something stirred in his chest—a mix of protectiveness and something deeper, sharper.

“I’m glad I’m here too,” he said, his voice quieter now. “Even if I’m pretty sure I stuck out like a sore thumb.”

Raven chuckled softly. “You did fine. Better than fine, actually.”

Luke let out a breath, his own smile surfacing. “Coming from you, I’ll take that as high praise.”

For a moment, they stood in comfortable silence, the sounds of the city below filling the gaps where words might have been. Then, Raven spoke, her tone thoughtful. “It’s strange, isn’t it? How different things feel out here. Like the world’s quieter somehow.”

Luke nodded. “Yeah. Feels like you can actually breathe out here.”

Raven turned her gaze back to the city, her expression unreadable. “Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to just… walk away from it all. Leave the expectations, the noise. Do something that actually feels real.”

“And push even further with diving?” Luke asked, his tone half-teasing but not unkind.

She glanced at him, her smile faint but genuine this time. “Maybe. Something like that.”

“You’d be good at it,” he said, the words slipping out before he could overthink them. “You already are.”

Raven’s gaze softened, and for a moment, Luke thought she might say something in return. But instead, she just nodded, her expression thoughtful.

“Thanks, Sunshine,” she said, the nickname carrying a surprising warmth. “Come on. Let’s head back before someone sends a search party.”

Luke hesitated, his gaze lingering on her for a beat longer. Then he nodded, following her back inside. The air seemed heavier as they stepped through the doors, but the quiet understanding they’d shared on the balcony lingered, like the faint light of the stars above.

### Scene: Back Inside

The warm hum of the gala embraced them again as Luke and Raven stepped back inside, the soft glow of chandeliers reflecting off polished floors and glittering jewelry. The buzz of conversation and the clink of glasses felt sharper after the quiet of the balcony, and Luke had to take a moment to adjust. Raven, as always, seemed unbothered by the shift, her calm confidence slipping back into place like a second skin.

She turned to him, her dark eyes steady. “I should go check in with my mother. She’ll be expecting me.”

Luke nodded, swallowing his immediate response. “Sure. Makes sense.”

“I’ll find you later,” she added, her tone light, but her gaze lingered just a second longer than he expected. Then, with a graceful turn, she melted into the crowd, her black gown flowing like liquid shadow.

He let out a quiet breath of relief. Meeting Raven’s mother—or anyone else from her family—was a level of interaction he wasn’t quite ready for. The evening had already pushed him out of his comfort zone in ways he hadn’t anticipated.

Luke made his way to a quieter corner of the room, leaning against a pillar with his hands shoved into his pockets. The events of the night churned in his mind, refusing to settle. Her words on the balcony echoed in his head: *Good to have my dive partner watching my back tonight.*

Dive partner. That’s what he was to her.

The thought should have been reassuring. Dive partners were essential, bound by trust and necessity. He’d always believed in keeping things professional, in drawing clear lines that prioritized survival over sentiment. But tonight… tonight, those lines felt blurred.

He thought back to the way she had lingered next to him after the ‘boyfriend’ charade. She hadn’t pulled away right away. And earlier, on the balcony, there had been something unspoken in her words, in the way she’d looked at him. Small moments, perhaps too subtle to mean anything at all—or maybe they meant everything.

Luke shook his head, trying to push the thought aside. She was his dive partner. That was the truth of it. Anything beyond that was dangerous, for both of them. Getting close to another diver … it was always a risk. It complicated things. And complications in a dungeon could get people killed.

He repeated that to himself like a mantra, hoping it would help. But the words felt hollow. Because when he thought about Raven—the way her presence steadied him, the way her wit challenged him, the way she seemed to trust him in ways he hadn’t expected—it didn’t feel like risk. It felt like something he couldn’t walk away from, no matter how much he tried to convince himself otherwise.

Luke glanced across the room, his eyes instinctively searching for her in the crowd. He caught a glimpse of her dark hair and elegant posture as she spoke with a woman who must have been her mother—same sharp eyes, same poised demeanor. He quickly looked away before either of them noticed.

*Dive partner,* he thought again, a quiet sigh escaping him. But the word felt inadequate, too small for what she really was. And too small for what she was beginning to mean to him.
