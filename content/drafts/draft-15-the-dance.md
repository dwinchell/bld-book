## Chapter 15: The Dance

### Scene: Making Rounds

The faint clink of crystal glasses and the rustle of silk gowns formed the backdrop to Raven’s evening, a symphony of affluence she had never quite grown accustomed to. Everywhere she turned, sharp-eyed donors and high-profile divers exchanged pleasantries, their words coated with politeness that hid ulterior motives. She adjusted the silver strap of her raven-shaped necklace, the cool metal grounding her as she prepared for yet another round of introductions.

Luke’s steady presence beside her was an unexpected relief. His simple, tailored suit made him look polished yet understated—a stark contrast to the ostentation around them. He’d already deflected two comments aimed at her with quiet poise, redirecting the conversations in a way that let her regain control. His presence at her side as they stopped near another group of guests felt like an anchor amidst the current of expectations.

And that, of course, was the problem. That, of course, was the problem. Raven didn’t need an anchor. She never had. She had weathered these things alone before, so why was she letting herself steady against him now? She prided herself on her independence, on her ability to navigate these social minefields alone. Yet here she was, leaning—just a little—on Luke’s calm and steady presence. The dichotomy made her chest tighten, as if the very idea of relying on someone else was an admission of weakness. But there was no denying that his support made it easier to breathe in this stifling room.

“Raven Blackwood, isn’t it?” The voice came from a man in his late forties, his eyes gleaming with recognition. “Leaderboards don’t do your accomplishments justice. Your last run through Felforge Depths was… inspiring.”

Raven forced a polite smile, masking her discomfort at being sized up like a prize. “Thank you. It was a team effort,” she replied, her tone even but noncommittal. She could almost feel Luke suppressing a knowing smile beside her.

The donor leaned in slightly, his expression sharpening. “With talent like yours, surely you’ve considered forming a guild? A diver of your caliber could do wonders leading the next generation.”

“I’ve given it some thought,” Raven lied smoothly, glancing briefly at Luke. His steady gaze met hers, a quiet reassurance in the chaos. “Right now, I’m focused on my own growth.”

Luke’s subtle intervention came in the form of an easy chuckle. “She’s unstoppable as she is. I’d hate to see her bogged down with admin work.” The comment drew polite laughter, and the donor nodded, seemingly satisfied with the diversion.

As the group dissolved into more innocuous chatter, Raven leaned slightly toward Luke and murmured, “You’ve got a knack for dodging traps.”

“Years of practice,” he replied, his tone light. “And a lot of overthinking.”

The faintest smile tugged at her lips. She wasn’t sure whether to find his humility amusing or endearing. Either way, his presence made the room’s sharp edges feel just a little softer.

They moved on to another cluster of guests, and as another round of pleasantries began, Raven caught herself reflecting on something unexpected: unlike previous events, she wasn't just enduring. There was something—someone—making it bearable.

A small but undeniable warmth settled in her chest. She straightened her spine, rolling back her shoulders as if to physically shrug it off. It didn’t work. The warmth remained, quiet but insistent.

# Scene: A Hole in the Armor

She excused herself at the next opportunity, making her way out of the grand hall and finding a quiet corner to sit and think for a moment. As she settled in, she examined her feelings minutely, turning them about like a piece of padded armor she knew there must be a hole in.

Two weeks ago, she had been a solo diver who needed no one in the dungon and wanted nothing more than to be in the dungeon. A diving partner had been the furthest thing from her mind. One last agonizing, heart pounding, near-miss failure had convinced her to rethink her strategy and led to her placing a classified ad for a healer. It had galled to admit that she, Raven Blackwood, couldn't go it alone. But that had been in the dungeon.

These events and the broader obligations of being a Blackwood were never something she had needed help with. Sure, it sucked. Sure, she tried to avoid it all as much as possible. But she didn't *need* anyone to get through it.

Now, she was acting like she needed someone to hold her hand and save her. In fact she had literally put on an act, let him hold her, and used him as an out with Julian. A few sharp words instead would have been enough to put Julian in his place. The only reason he had approached was she hadn't been firm enough last time. For that matter, she could have simply Shadow Stepped behind him and whispered a sweet nothing in his ear like "get lost". Maybe she would next time. Maybe she ... stop.

It wasn't Julian she was angry with. It was herself. She could have handled Julian. She could have handled the schmoozing. She could have handled everything. She always had. So why did the idea of doing it without Luke now feel … lonelier than it should?

Beyond needing anyone, she hadn't wanted anyone. Sure, she had her social circle - a few friendly faces at the Warden's Rest, a few friends from school she messaged or met up with occasionally. But she relentlessly focused on diving. No time for close friendships. No desire to engage in other pursuits. Still living with her parents because she coudln't be bothered to find her own place. And definitely not looking for a boyfriend.

"Everything okay?" She looked up and Luke stood before her, his warm blue eyes focused on her. She looked at him then, really looked at him. His white dinner jacket virtually shone in the bright lights of the chandellier above. Something about its cut and his pose brought the armor analogy back to her mind. Backlit from this angle, his short blond locks framed his face gave him a pituresque look. "Raven?" He managed to sound solicitous but not concerned. Not worried for her. Not pressing. Just asking. That slight warmth grew in her chest again.

"I just needed to be alone."

"Oh, ok. Sorry to interrupt. I'll leave you to your thoughts." He turned to go. He wouldn't even have the decency to be clingy so she could push him away.

She stood. "No, I think I'm ready for another round now." She would have to sort through this later.

### Scene: On the Dance Floor

Hours later, the warm glow of chandeliers reflected off the polished marble floor as the soft strains of a waltz filled the air. Raven lingered at the edge of the dance floor, her fingers toying with the strap of her raven necklace. Her heels clicked faintly against the floor as she shifted her weight, torn between staying in the comfortable anonymity of the sidelines and stepping into the world of polished smiles and deliberate movements.

On impulse, she turned to Luke, who stood beside her, quietly observing the scene. “Dance with me,” she said, the words out of her mouth before she could overthink them.

Luke blinked, a flicker of surprise crossing his face. "I don't know how."

She grinned and took his hand. "Keep up."

The orchestra’s melody wrapped around them, its cadence soothing yet unfamiliar. Raven guided him into the rhythm, backleading. His steps were hesitant at first, but he quickly found his footing. His hand rested lightly on her waist, steady and reassuring.

"Well, you haven't tripped,” she said, her tone teasing but quieter than usual.

“Thanks,” he said, his lips curving into a small smile. "I can adapt too.”

She raised an eyebrow. “Adapt, huh? Is that what this is?”

“Something like that,” he said, his voice calm. He began to lead in truth then, guiding and turning her through the melody.

The music swelled, and for a moment, Raven let herself follow his lead. She didn’t overthink her movements, didn’t think about the people watching. And then, at some point, she realized she wasn’t thinking about it at all. And that—that scared her more than anything. She nearly stumbled, her pulse kicking up—not from the dance, but from the terrifying realization that she liked this. Liked the way it felt to let go.

“You’re not half bad at this,” she said after a long moment, her voice quieter now.

“Thanks,” he replied, his tone light. “But you’re the one making us look good.”

Raven smirked faintly but didn’t reply. Instead, she glanced around, noting the other dancers with their practiced grace. She wondered how many of them felt as out of place as she did—how many were just pretending.

“Do you think they’re all as confident as they look?” she asked, surprising herself with the question.

Luke followed her gaze briefly before answering. “Probably not. But confidence is half the battle, right?”

“Hmm,” she murmured, thoughtful. 

As the song drew to a close, Raven felt the tension she’d carried all evening ease, replaced by something softer and more unsettling. She stepped back as the final note lingered in the air, her hand slipping from his as if breaking a spell. The world around her came back into focus: the clinking glasses, the murmur of conversations, the distant sound of laughter.

“Well, that was unexpected,” she said, her tone deliberately light.

Luke tilted his head slightly. “Good unexpected or bad unexpected?”

“Still deciding,” she tried to smirk, but the words came out uncertainly. 

As they walked off the floor, that small but undeniable warmth lingered in her chest, refusing to fade.

### Scene: Departure

The gala was winding down, the music fading to softer, slower pieces as guests began to trickle out. Raven stood near the exit, her gaze following the shifting crowd as she adjusted the strap of her necklace. The earlier ease she had felt on the dance floor with Luke was slipping away, replaced by a growing sense of unease that coiled tight in her chest. She wasn’t sure what unsettled her more: the warmth she’d felt in his presence tonight or the fact that she had let herself rely on him at all.

Luke appeared beside her, his steady presence grounding her even as it deepened her inner conflict. “Heading out?” he asked, his voice quiet but cutting through the chatter around them.

She nodded, glancing at him briefly. “You?”

“Yeah. Thought I’d better call it a night,” he said. His tone was light, but there was a trace of hesitation, as though he wasn’t quite ready to leave yet.

“Good idea,” she said, folding her arms loosely as they stepped into the cool night air. The breeze tugged at the edges of her dress, the sharp chill a welcome contrast the warmth of the ballroom.

They walked in silence toward the curb, their footsteps falling into an easy rhythm. Raven’s heels clicked against the pavement, while Luke’s stride remained measured and deliberate. She glanced at him, noting the calm set of his features and the way he carried himself, as though nothing could touch him. It was infuriating—and oddly reassuring. But she hated how much she found comfort in it. Her thoughts circled back to the memory that just two weeks ago, she’d been fine on her own, perfectly capable of handling everything without anyone else. And yet, here she was, letting someone else steady her in a way she hadn’t even asked for.

“You know,” she said finally, breaking the silence, “I’m not sure if tonight was a win or just… exhausting.”

Luke’s lips curved into a faint smile. “Can it be both?”

She huffed a quiet laugh. “I guess so.”

They stopped near the curb, the streetlamp casting faint shadows over the pavement. Raven’s fingers brushed against the strap of her necklace as she looked up at him. “Thanks for… everything tonight. I’m not sure I’d have made it through without you.”

“You would have,” he said without hesitation. “But I’m glad I could help.”

Her stomach twisted at his words. Of course she could have made it through. She always did. But tonight, it hadn’t been about survival—it had been about letting someone else share the weight, even if just for a little while. And that realization felt heavier than anything she’d faced inside the ballroom.

“How do you do that?” she asked suddenly.

“Do what?”

“Make everything seem… manageable,” she said, her voice quieter now, almost introspective. “Like it’s not as big of a deal as it feels.”

Luke tilted his head slightly, considering her words. “Maybe because it’s not as big of a deal as it feels. Or maybe because I’ve had practice putting things into perspective.”

Raven nodded slowly, letting his words settle. But they didn’t feel as comforting as she’d expected. Because what she couldn’t admit—not to him, not even to herself fully—was that it wasn’t the night’s challenges that felt overwhelming. It wasn't even how much she had leaned on him. It was how much she’d wanted to.

The car he’d called pulled up, its engine idling softly. She glanced at it, then back at him, her fingers tightening briefly on her necklace. “Perspective, huh?”

“It helps,” he said simply. 

Another stretch of silence passed, comfortable in its own way, yet heavy with things unsaid.

She smiled faintly, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes. As he opened the car door, he glanced back at her. "Talk to you tomorrow?”

"I'll message you,” she confirmed with a small nod.

He slid into the car, the door shutting with a quiet thud. As the car rolled away, Raven lingered at the curb, the night breeze brushing against her skin. Her thoughts churned, a tangled mix of warmth, unease, and something far too close to reliance. Two weeks ago, she hadn’t needed anyone. She still didn’t. Did she? Raven clenched her jaw, willing herself to believe it. But the small, persistent warmth in her chest refused to fade. And that terrified her most of all.
