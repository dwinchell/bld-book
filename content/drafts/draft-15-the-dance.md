## Chapter 15: The Dance

### Scene: Making Rounds

The faint clink of crystal glasses and the rustle of silk gowns formed the backdrop to Raven’s evening, a symphony of affluence she had never quite grown accustomed to. Everywhere she turned, sharp-eyed donors and high-profile divers exchanged pleasantries, their words coated with politeness that hid ulterior motives. She adjusted the silver strap of her raven-shaped necklace, the cool metal grounding her as she prepared for yet another round of introductions.

Luke’s steady presence beside her was an unexpected relief. His simple, tailored suit made him look polished yet understated—a stark contrast to the ostentation around them. He’d already deflected two comments aimed at her with quiet poise, redirecting the conversations in a way that let her regain control. His calm hand lightly resting on the small of her back as he guided her toward another group of guests felt like an anchor amidst the current of expectations.

And that, of course, was the problem. Raven hated how much she appreciated the anchor. She prided herself on her independence, on her ability to navigate these social minefields alone. Yet here she was, leaning—just a little—on Luke’s calm and steady presence. The dichotomy made her chest tighten, as if the very idea of relying on someone else was an admission of weakness. But there was no denying that his support made it easier to breathe in this stifling room.

“Raven Blackwood, isn’t it?” The voice came from a man in his late forties, his eyes gleaming with recognition. “Leaderboards don’t do your accomplishments justice. Your last run through Felforge Depths was… inspiring.”

Raven forced a polite smile, masking her discomfort at being sized up like a prize. “Thank you. It was a team effort,” she replied, her tone even but noncommittal. She could almost feel Luke suppressing a knowing smile beside her.

The donor leaned in slightly, his expression sharpening. “With talent like yours, surely you’ve considered forming a guild? A diver of your caliber could do wonders leading the next generation.”

“I’ve given it some thought,” Raven lied smoothly, glancing briefly at Luke. His steady gaze met hers, a quiet reassurance in the chaos. “Right now, I’m focused on my own growth.”

Luke’s subtle intervention came in the form of an easy chuckle. “She’s unstoppable as she is. I’d hate to see her bogged down with admin work.” The comment drew polite laughter, and the donor nodded, seemingly satisfied with the diversion.

As the group dissolved into more innocuous chatter, Raven leaned slightly toward Luke and murmured, “You’ve got a knack for dodging traps.”

“Years of practice,” he replied, his tone light. “And a lot of overthinking.”

The faintest smile tugged at her lips. She wasn’t sure whether to find his humility amusing or endearing. Either way, his presence made the room’s sharp edges feel just a little softer.

They moved on to another cluster of guests, Luke’s steady hand guiding her again. As another round of pleasantries began, Raven caught herself reflecting on something unexpected: unlike previous events, she wasn't just enduring. There was something—someone—making it bearable. A small but undeniable warmth settled in her chest, and though she couldn’t quite name it, she knew it had everything to do with the man standing quietly by her side. And that unsettled her.
