  title: "Splitting the Gala Chapter"
  file: "split-gala-chapters.yaml"

approach:
  rationale: >
    The decision to split the gala into two chapters stems from the need to give each protagonist their own emotional arc within the same event. 
    This structure allows for a richer exploration of Luke and Raven's internal conflicts and feelings while maintaining clear POV boundaries.
    Splitting the chapters also avoids cramming too many pivotal moments into one chapter, ensuring emotional beats land effectively.

  benefits:
    - "Allows each character's emotional journey to be fully developed and distinct."
    - "Provides room to explore Luke's realization of his romantic feelings without rushing his fear of attachment arc."
    - "Creates space for Raven's family expectations subplot, showing how Luke supports her in navigating those pressures."
    - "Maintains reader investment by heightening romantic tension—Luke admits his feelings to himself, while Raven remains conflicted."

  narrative-purpose:
    chapter-1: >
      Luke's chapter focuses on his experience of the gala, emphasizing his discomfort in high society, his role in the pretend boyfriend moment, 
      and his reflection on the balcony where he realizes he is falling for Raven but is terrified of what that means.
    chapter-2: >
      Raven's chapter shifts focus to her family dynamics and societal expectations, showing her leaning on Luke for emotional support. 
      It culminates in the dance, where Raven takes a vulnerable step toward acknowledging her feelings but leaves conflicted about what they mean.
