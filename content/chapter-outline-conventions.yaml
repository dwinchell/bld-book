  title: "Chapter Outline Conventions"
  file: "chapter-outline-conventions.yaml"

purpose: >
  This document defines conventions for referring to parts of chapter outline files during the drafting workflow.
  The goal is to streamline communication and ensure clarity when discussing or updating different parts of the files.

definitions:
  chapter-outline: >
    The entire YAML file containing all details about a single chapter. It includes chapter-level fields, 
    scene outlines, and any additional fields relevant to drafting the chapter.

  chapter-headers: >
    The collection of fields at the chapter level, which describe the overall structure, purpose, and goals of the chapter.
    These include:
      - `metadata`: Organizational details such as file type, chapter title, and filename.
      - `plot-summary`: A high-level overview of the chapter’s events and outcomes.
      - `narrative-purpose`: The chapter’s role in advancing the story and themes.
      - `relationship-progression`: Details tracking the evolution of the protagonists' relationship throughout the chapter.
      - `key-emotional-beats`: Major emotional moments or turning points in the chapter.

  scene-outlines: >
    The individual scene items within a chapter outline. Each scene outline describes a specific moment in the chapter and contains the following fields:
      - `scene`: A short title summarizing the focus of the scene.
      - `perspective`: The POV character for the scene.
      - `plot-summary`: A brief overview of what happens in the scene.
      - `narrative-purpose`: The role the scene plays in the chapter or story.
      - `events`: A list of key actions or developments within the scene.
      - `sensory-details`: One or two sensory elements (e.g., sights, sounds, smells) that enhance the scene’s tone or purpose. 
                          These should be specific, vivid, and contribute meaningfully to immersion.
      - `scene-hook`: How the scene begins to engage the reader or set up its purpose.
      - `ending`: How the scene concludes, whether through resolution, transition, or open-ended tension.

  fields: >
    Each individual element within a chapter header or scene outline is referred to as a **field**. 
    Fields provide specific details or instructions for drafting. Examples of fields include:
      - In chapter headers: `plot-summary`, `narrative-purpose`, and `key-emotional-beats`.
      - In scene outlines: `events`, `plot-summary`, `sensory-details`, and `ending`.

examples:
  - chapter-outline:
      description: >
        "A Gala Invitation" is a chapter outline containing all information about this chapter, including chapter headers 
        and multiple scene outlines. The file is saved as `chapter-a-gala-invitation.yaml`.
  - chapter-headers:
      description: >
        In the same chapter outline, fields like `plot-summary`, `narrative-purpose`, and `key-emotional-beats` are part of the chapter headers.
  - scene-outlines:
      description: >
        The scene titled "Shopping for a Tuxedo" is a scene outline within the chapter outline. Its fields, such as `plot-summary` 
        and `events`, describe the content and purpose of this specific scene.
  - fields:
      description: >
        Fields refer to the individual components of both chapter headers and scene outlines. For example:
          - `plot-summary` is a field in both the chapter headers and each scene outline.
          - `events` is a field in scene outlines and lists key actions within the scene.
          - `sensory-details` is a field that should include only one or two carefully chosen sensory elements that enrich the scene without overwhelming it.

sensory-details-guidance:
  purpose: >
    The `sensory-details` field exists to enhance immersion and set the tone for a scene. By including sensory elements 
    such as sights, sounds, smells, or textures, this field helps convey the mood and atmosphere effectively.
  conventions:
    - Include only one or two sensory details per scene to maintain focus and avoid overloading the outline.
    - Choose sensory details that:
      - Reflect the scene’s tone or emotional impact.
      - Add depth to the setting or action without distracting from the primary events.
      - Are specific and vivid to create a strong impression.
  examples:
    - recommended:
        - "The hum of conversation and the clink of glasses in the busy tavern."
        - "The crisp paper of the gala invitation in Luke’s hands as he turns it over thoughtfully."
    - not-recommended:
        - "The hum of conversation, the clink of glasses, the smoky air, the faint smell of leather, and the warm glow of the tavern lights." (Too many details for one scene.)
        - "A generic pleasant smell filled the room." (Too vague to add meaningful depth.)

usage:
  - When referring to the entire YAML file: Use "chapter outline."
  - When discussing chapter-level fields: Use "chapter headers."
  - When referring to a specific scene within the chapter: Use "scene outline."
  - When referring to an individual element within a chapter header or scene outline: Use "field" (e.g., the `plot-summary` field or the `events` field).

notes:
  - These conventions are designed to simplify collaboration and minimize confusion when discussing different parts of the workflow.
  - For new chapter outlines, follow the structure outlined in `chapter-outline-template.yaml`.
  - For consistency, refer to specific fields by their exact names (e.g., `plot-summary`, `narrative-purpose`) to avoid ambiguity.
  - Keep the `sensory-details` field concise and purposeful, ensuring it serves the narrative and tonal goals of the scene.
