overview:
  perspective: Raven
  narrative-purpose: >
    Raven processes the emotional fallout from the gala, struggles with her growing reliance on Luke, and ultimately decides to embrace it.
    After a near-failure in a solo dungeon run, she acknowledges that trust is not weakness—it’s necessary.
    She chooses the most extreme way to prove this to herself: running the Radiant Spire with Luke.
  plot-summary: >
    - Raven isolates herself after the gala, unsettled by how much she relied on Luke.
    - She forces herself into a solo dungeon run, needing to prove she doesn’t need anyone.
    - The run goes badly—she barely escapes, forced to confront the reality of her limits.
    - A quiet moment with Luke after the run makes her realize she wants to stop fighting this.
    - She hears about the Radiant Spire and fixates on it—it’s a perfect metaphor for trust.
    - She tries to rationalize away the idea but ultimately embraces it.
    - Raven asks Luke to run the Spire with her. He refuses, calling her reckless.
    - The rejection **hurts**—she wasn’t offering a challenge; she was offering *them*.
    - Raven shuts him out completely.

tone:
  - "Introspective and tense at the start."
  - "High-stakes action and frustration in the solo dungeon run."
  - "Quiet, bittersweet realization before she makes her decision."

scenes:
  - title: "A Mind That Won’t Quiet"
    perspective: Raven
    plot-summary: >
      In the aftermath of the gala, Raven finds herself restless, unable to shake how much she relied on Luke.
      Instead of feeling comforted, she feels exposed—like she’s let him too close.
      She isolates herself, retreating into familiar patterns, pushing away what she doesn’t want to face.
    events:
      - Raven holes up in her apartment, avoiding messages and drowning herself in training.
      - She replays the gala moments in her head—the pretend boyfriend moment, Luke’s steadiness, how *safe* she felt.
      - Instead of acknowledging her feelings, she gets angry—at herself, at Luke, at how easily he seems to navigate trust.
    key-emotional-beats:
      - Raven refuses to acknowledge her feelings as fear—she frames them as *losing control* instead.
      - The more she tries to shake the thoughts, the stronger they return.
    ending: >
      Needing to reclaim her independence, Raven decides to do a solo dungeon run—something challenging, to prove she doesn’t need anyone.

  - title: "Going It Alone"
    perspective: Raven
    plot-summary: >
      Raven enters a high-level dungeon alone, determined to reaffirm her strength.
      She starts strong, but miscalculations pile up, leading to a near-disastrous failure.
      She barely escapes, shaken by the realization that she’s hit her limit.
    events:
      - Raven pushes herself aggressively, cutting down enemies with precision.
      - A tactical mistake forces her into an attrition battle she didn’t plan for.
      - She gets **hurt**, and for the first time in a long while, there’s no backup.
      - Forced to retreat, she barely makes it out before the dungeon collapse.
    key-emotional-beats:
      - The failure isn’t dramatic—it’s subtle, creeping, **a slow unraveling of control**.
      - She realizes she **doesn’t just want someone to watch her back—she wants *him*.**
    ending: >
      Beaten, bruised, and frustrated, Raven returns home

  - title: "The Radiant Spire"
    perspective: Raven
    plot-summary: >
      The idea of the Spire takes hold—an impossible challenge that demands absolute trust.
      She tries to shake the thought, but she keeps coming back to it.
      Eventually, she gives in. If she and Luke can do *that*, then nothing else matters.
    events:
      - Raven does research on the Spire—no one has ever cleared it.
      - The stories intrigue her. The mechanics demand **total synchronization**—exactly what she fears.
      - She argues with herself, resisting the idea, but the conclusion is inevitable.
    key-emotional-beats:
      - "She stops running from the truth: she wants to trust Luke completely, and this is how she’ll prove she can."
    ending: >
      Raven makes her decision. She’s going to ask him.

  - title: "The Proposal"
    perspective: Raven
    plot-summary: >
      Raven finds Luke and, in her usual direct way, asks him to run the Radiant Spire with her.
      Luke immediately refuses, calling her reckless.
      She brushes it off like it’s just another challenge—but inside, it cuts deeper than she expected.
    events:
      - Raven finds Luke and, without preamble, says: “Run the Radiant Spire with me.”
      - Luke is caught off guard—then immediately refuses.
      - He calls it reckless, saying no one has survived it. She counters: “That’s why I want to do it.”
      - Luke sees through it—this isn’t about the challenge, it’s about trust.
      - He says no—not because he doesn’t believe in her, but because she doesn’t understand what she’s asking.
      - The rejection stings in a way she wasn’t prepared for.
    key-emotional-beats:
      - Raven wasn’t just offering him a challenge—she was offering **them**.
      - Luke’s refusal makes her feel like she **miscalculated something deeply personal**.
    ending: >
      Hurt and humiliated, Raven shuts him out completely, setting up the next stage of their conflict.
