overview:
  perspective: Raven
  narrative-purpose: >
    This chapter shifts the focus from Raven and Luke’s developing intimacy to Raven’s integration into Luke’s world. Through her interactions with Anna, she gets an outside perspective on Luke, understanding parts of his life that he never talks about. What starts as playful mischief—inviting Anna out—becomes a quiet realization: if she wants to truly know Luke, she has to understand the people he’s spent his life protecting.

"The Black Dress" serves as a quiet moment for Raven to process her emotions, and a playful callback when they return home, keeping the balance between humor and emotional depth.
