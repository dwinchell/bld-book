plot-summary: >
  Luke and Raven navigate a water-themed dungeon, facing a series of battles that test their trust and teamwork. Luke’s overprotectiveness, heightened by his growing emotional connection to Raven, causes inefficiencies in his healing. As the dungeon progresses, Raven forces him to recognize that health is a resource, and he learns to adjust his approach. By the end, he is able to heal strategically rather than reactively, reducing his anxiety but acknowledging that overcoming his protective instincts will take time.
