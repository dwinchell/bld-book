  - scene: The First Lesson
    perspective: Raven Blackwood
    plot-summary: >
      Raven approaches Garrett, the young Night Dancer she previously helped, who nervously asks if they’re running a dungeon together. She tells him no—he’s running solo, and she’ll just be there. When he hesitates, she gives him a blunt but meaningful lesson about self-sufficiency, reinforcing that soloing makes a diver good, but duoing makes them great. With his resolve steeled, they step into the portal together.

      This scene provides a quiet but definitive resolution to Raven’s arc.

      - Raven tells him no—he’s running solo, and she’ll just be there.
      - Garrett hesitates, visibly intimidated by the idea.
      - Raven delivers her lesson about self-sufficiency: soloing makes you good, duoing makes you great, but you have to be strong on your own or you bring nothing to the team.
      - Garrett absorbs the lesson, his initial fear shifting into determination.
      - Raven gives him a final, assessing look before saying, “Let’s go.”
      - She steps into the portal, and after a moment, Garrett follows.

      - The portal’s glow flickers across Garrett’s anxious expression.
      - The weight of silence between them, punctuated only by the distant murmur of other divers preparing their own runs.
