      - Luke hesitates, feeling like they should be preparing more, but realizes he doesn’t actually want to say no.
      - Raven casually calls it "a break" but there’s an unspoken understanding that this is a date.
      - The decision itself shows how much they’ve changed—early on, neither of them would have taken a night off.
    ending: >
      Luke agrees, more curious than he lets on.

    plot-summary: >
      They go somewhere unexpected—Raven picks a quiet rooftop bar overlooking the city. It’s a stark contrast to their usual adrenaline-filled environments, forcing them to slow down and exist in a space where there’s no immediate danger.
    key-emotional-beats:
      - Luke, always scanning for threats, struggles to fully relax at first.

    key-emotional-beats:
      - Luke confesses that for a long time, **his reason was survival**—for himself, for Anna. But now, he’s realizing that’s not enough.
      - Raven admits that **pushing forward is the only thing that’s ever made sense to her**—but she’s starting to think about what comes after.
      - The unspoken truth: they are becoming part of each other’s reasons.
    ending: >

  - title: "The Quiet Between the Battles"
    perspective: Luke
    plot-summary: >
      As the night winds down, neither of them is in a hurry to leave. There’s something sacred about the stillness, the understanding that this is temporary but real.
    key-emotional-beats:
      - They don’t rush to fill the silence, comfortable just being there together.
      - Luke recognizes that this is **what he’s been missing all along—a life beyond just surviving.**
      - Raven, for once, doesn’t feel the need to run.
    ending: >
      As they walk away from the rooftop, there’s an unspoken agreement: whatever happens next, they’re not fighting alone anymore.
