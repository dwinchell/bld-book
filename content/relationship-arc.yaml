  purpose: Describe the relationship arc as it affects Raven's character and her perspective
  start: >
    Raven’s bold, risk-taking nature often clashes with Luke’s cautious, measured approach. She sees his deliberation
    as overly rigid and frustrating, while he views her independence as reckless. Initially, she resists his attempts to
    impose structure on their teamwork, preferring to act on instinct rather than collaborate closely.

    Their combat synergy develops as she learns to trust his tactical decisions, such as relying on his zones and barriers
    to create openings for her aggressive playstyle. Outside the dungeon, their dynamic softens as Luke’s calm, nurturing
    personality provides a counterbalance to Raven’s intensity. Through quiet moments of reflection, playful banter,
    and shared struggles, Raven discovers the value of having someone she can truly rely on. She encourages Luke to take
    more risks and embrace the thrill of the moment, pushing him to step outside his comfort zone, while he helps her
    understand the strength found in planning and interdependence.
