      Over time, Raven begins to appreciate Luke’s strategic mindset and his ability to create stability in the chaos of battle.
      Their combat synergy develops as she learns to trust his tactical decisions, such as relying on his zones and barriers
      to create openings for her aggressive playstyle. Outside the dungeon, Luke’s calm, nurturing personality provides a counterbalance to Raven’s intensity. 
      Through playful banter, moments of reflection, and shared struggles, Raven realizes the value of relying on someone she trusts.
