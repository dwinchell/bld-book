The combat layer, set in dungeons, refines their synergy, while the emotional layer deepens their bond outside battle. Each reinforces the other, driving themes of Trust and Vulnerability, The Power of Partnership, and Independence vs Interdependence. The layers section details each path, while the progression section maps their growth chapter by chapter, tagging each by primary development focus.
