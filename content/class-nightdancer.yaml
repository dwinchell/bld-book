type: class
name: Night Dancer

theme: >
  An agile, shadow-infused fighter who combines graceful movement and deliberate defense to dominate the battlefield.
  The Night Dancer thrives on precision, using their unique ability to intentionally block or grab attacks, generating power through her resource, Flow, to unleash devastating and sustaining abilities.
  While technically a tank class due to its ability to control the attention of foes and survive in close quarters, its survivability depends largely on precise evasions and careful resource management.
  Its signature cloth armor and lack of a physical shield allows little room for error.
