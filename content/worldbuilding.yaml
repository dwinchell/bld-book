  name: "The Warden's Rest"
  description: >
    A lively pub blending modern design—polished wood, steel accents, and warm lighting—with dungeon-diver nostalgia. Displays of shattered armor, ancient weapons, and framed maps evoke camaraderie and pride. The hum of chatter and laughter fills the air, creating a vibrant yet comforting space where divers unwind after grueling dives. A boss core encased in glass is on the back wall, glowing eerily.
