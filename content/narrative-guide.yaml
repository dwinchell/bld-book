workflow-conventions:
  cross-referencing:
    purpose: >
      Provide clear and consistent standards for referencing content across YAML files. 
      These standards ensure clarity and ease of use in all workflows, including outline generation, drafting, YAML validation, 
      and general LLM responses. The conventions are designed to maintain modularity, support enriched storytelling, 
      and ensure data integrity across files.
    applies-to:
      - "Outline generation"
      - "Drafting responses"
      - "YAML validation"
      - "General context expansion in LLM responses"
    syntax:
      reference: "<file_name>_<context_type>_<content_identifier>"
      description: >
        The syntax for cross-referencing includes three parts:
        - `<file_name>`: The YAML file where the referenced content is defined (e.g., `abilities.yaml`).
        - `<context_type>`: The type of content being referenced (e.g., `character`, `dungeon`, `theme`).
        - `<content_identifier>`: The exact name of the referenced content, enclosed in double quotes. This must match the source file exactly.
    examples:
      - type: "Ability Reference"
        example: "reference: abilities.yaml_character_'Beacon of Judgement'"
      - type: "Dungeon Reference"
        example: "reference: dungeons.yaml_dungeon_'Shadow Warrens'"
      - type: "Theme Reference"
        example: "reference: themes.yaml_theme_'Light and Darkness'"
    guidelines:
      - "Use exact names for `<content_identifier>`, ensuring they match the source file exactly, including capitalization and spacing."
      - "Avoid special characters (e.g., `/`, `#`, `*`) in names that may cause parsing issues."
      - "Include `<file_name>` and `<context_type>` to minimize ambiguity and simplify parsing."
      - "Update references whenever content identifiers or file names are renamed to prevent errors."
    llm-usage:
      parsing-instructions:
        - "Locate `reference` fields in YAML files."
        - "Extract `<file_name>`, `<context_type>`, and `<content_identifier>` from the reference string."
      resolving-references:
        - "Open the specified `<file_name>`."
        - "Search for entries matching `<context_type>` and `<content_identifier>`."
        - "Retrieve the referenced content for use in the current context."
      validation:
        - "Ensure the `content_identifier` exists in the specified `<file_name>`."
        - "Check for typos, case mismatches, or missing files during parsing."
      enrichment:
        - "Use referenced content to enhance responses with relevant details (e.g., ability descriptions, dungeon mechanics)."
        - "Avoid duplicating the reference string in responses unless explicitly instructed."
      error-handling:
        - "Notify the user if a reference cannot be resolved, providing suggestions for corrections."
        - example-error-response: >
            "The reference abilities.yaml_character_'Radiant Strike' could not be found. Please ensure it exists and is correctly named."
    narrative-integration:
      description: >
        The conventions ensure referenced content is integrated seamlessly into YAML workflows, narrative elements, and validation processes, 
        allowing for enriched storytelling, modular file management, and consistent responses.
      usage:
        - "Include ability references in key event descriptions to ensure the narrative incorporates character mechanics naturally."
        - "Use dungeon references in chapter outlines to maintain continuity with the story's setting."
      example-behavior:
        input: |
          abilities:
            radiant-strike:
              reference: abilities.yaml_character_"Radiant Strike"
        llm-response: >
          Parse the reference and retrieve:
          - `file_name`: `abilities.yaml`
          - `context_type`: `character`
          - `content_identifier`: `Radiant Strike`
          Resolve and use the corresponding entry:
          - "Radiant Strike is an offensive ability that deals light damage and generates a Light Charge. It reflects Luke’s methodical combat style."
