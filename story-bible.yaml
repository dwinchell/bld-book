    system:
      description: >
        The System is a mysterious construct with a user interface reminiscent of video-game menus and heads-up displays.
        It integrates with human society and grants access to dungeons, adventuring classes, and rewards.
      origins: >
        The System integration event occurred in 2000 when terminals mysteriously appeared overnight across the globe.
        No one knows the origins of the System, but its presence has become normalized in society.
        registration: >
        Any human aged 18 or older can register as a diver by visiting a Terminal. Registration grants them access to dungeons 
        and the permanent, customizable System interface available exclusively to divers.
      interface:
        non-divers: >
          Non-divers access the System via touch screens on Terminals located in public and private spaces.
        divers: >
          Upon registering as a diver, individuals gain persistent access to the System interface, which functions 
          like an augmented reality display without requiring a headset. Divers can interact with the interface using 
          thought or a chosen method, such as hand gestures.
        hud: >
          Divers start with a heads-up display (HUD) that shows basic status information, including health, cooldowns, 
          and monster names once visual contact is established. Abilities can expand HUD functionality.
        customization: >
          The default System theme is minimalistic, featuring text and boxes similar to Terminal menus. Divers can 
          customize the interface to suit their preferences, including colors, layouts, and interaction methods.
        projection: >
          Divers can project their interface onto surfaces or into the air, allowing for greater flexibility and convenience. 
          For example, Raven often projects screens onto her desk, using it like a touch screen for managing dungeon reports.
