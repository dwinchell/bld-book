## Chapter: Resources

### Scene 1

The air inside the dungeon was thick with moisture, the scent of damp stone and rushing water pressing in around them. Walls of smooth rock gleamed under the soft, reflective glow of unseen light sources, carved over centuries by flowing currents. The distant echo of dripping water suggested the dungeon itself wasn’t entirely still.

Luke kept pace with Raven as they moved through the cavernous tunnels. His gaze flicked between the shifting reflections on the wet stone and the mana bar in his HUD. He was running lower than expected—far lower. Healing her had been costing him more than usual, and he knew exactly why.

Ahead, Raven darted toward a towering water construct that rose from a pool, its form shifting and undulating like a wave poised to crash. Luke tensed. Its movements were fluid but deliberate, and each strike it landed would hurt—if it landed. He tracked Raven’s path as she wove through its sweeping attacks with precise footwork, her agility keeping her just beyond reach. His grip on his staff tightened, his instincts screaming at him to intervene.

She took a glancing blow to the shoulder. Luke’s HUD flickered—**Minor Injury (Shoulder). Slight stamina drain.** He reacted instantly, casting Brilliant Mend, light flaring from his staff as the yellow-marked area on her HUD dimmed.

Raven exhaled sharply, pivoting away from the construct. “You need to stop that.”

Luke frowned. “You took a hit.”

“I was fine,” she countered, dodging another fluid strike. “That wasn’t a wound. That was positioning. And now you’re down another chunk of mana.”

Luke’s jaw tightened. He had noticed it earlier—he was healing her more often than before, reacting faster than necessary. Before, he had balanced resource management with the realities of combat. Now, his instincts overrode strategy, demanding he keep her at full health, no matter the cost.

The problem was, dungeons didn’t care about his instincts.

Raven baited the construct into another sweeping motion, then pivoted around it, using the momentum to land a precise slash across its core. 

A warning flashed in Luke’s HUD. **Mana Low.**

Shit.

He adjusted, pulling back on active healing. But as the fight continued, another construct emerged from the far pool, rippling into shape like a wave reforming from the water’s surface.

Luke’s pulse jumped. Raven was in its path, and though she moved fast, there were limits. He poured his remaining mana into Guiding Radiance, reinforcing her with a healing-over-time effect.

The moment the fight ended, Luke barely had time to catch his breath before Raven turned on him.

“Luke.” Her voice was firm, edged with something that wasn’t quite anger—but wasn’t far from it either. “You’re out of mana again.”

He set his jaw. “I know.”

She crossed her arms. “And why is that?”

He sighed. “Because I overcommitted healing. But you—”

“No,” she cut in. “It’s because you don’t trust me to handle myself.”

Luke opened his mouth to argue but stopped. She wasn’t wrong.

Raven stepped closer, tilting her head. “Alright. You’re out of mana. I still have Flow. Watch.”

Before he could stop her, she deliberately let the next construct strike her. Then, as if to emphasize the point, she slipped effortlessly past the next two attacks, her movements fluid and precise. Luke’s HUD flared—**Moderate Injury (Torso). Movement slightly impaired.** His stomach twisted as the impact sent ripples through the water, but she rolled with it, absorbing the blow with a partial block. Dark energy flared around her.

Her Flow bar surged.

Luke clenched his fists. “Raven—”

“Still fine,” she said evenly, shaking out her shoulders. The red glow on his HUD’s ragdoll lingered, but Raven’s movements remained sharp, unfazed by the damage. “I just got a huge boost to my resource generation.” She turned toward him, expression unreadable. “You see what’s happening here?”

Luke exhaled through his nose. He did.

Luke’s gaze flicked to his HUD’s ragdoll interface. The torso section glowed red, a clear indicator of a moderate injury, but Raven still moved without hesitation. A system notification followed: **Raven: Moderate Injury (Torso). Movement slightly impaired.** Luke couldn’t see her exact numbers, but he didn’t need to. The aura of flowing shadows around Raven had grown denser, curling around her limbs in waves that pulsed with energy. He had seen this before—her Flow was at its peak. “This is how I work. My class thrives on momentum. If you keep stopping me from taking manageable hits, you’re cutting off my ability to fight at full strength.”

She took a healing potion from her belt and drank it in measured sips, waiting as the regeneration effect set in. A new system alert flashed across his HUD—**Healing Over Time Applied. Moderate Injury Recovery in Progress.** The red marking on the ragdoll faded back to neutral. “See? I can take care of myself. You’re wasting mana trying to keep me at full when I don’t need to be.”

Luke looked at his empty resource bar. He had always seen health as something to protect. She saw it as a tool.

She turned back to him with an arched brow. “So. Do you trust me?”

He inhaled deeply, letting the realization settle. Then, finally, he nodded. “Yeah.”

Raven smirked. “Then let’s try this again.”

### Scene 2

Luke took a steadying breath as Raven turned back toward the dungeon’s twisting pathways, her steps fluid, confidence barely shaken. He wished he could share that same certainty. The closer they had become, the harder it was to hold back—to let her take risks when every instinct screamed at him to shield her. But he had to. If he didn't, he’d drain himself dry again, and then he wouldn’t be able to help her when it truly mattered. Her steps were fluid, confidence unshaken. The distant sound of rushing water echoed through the cavern, a reminder that they weren’t done here yet.

He flexed his fingers around his staff, his mana still dangerously low. The tension sat heavy in his chest. It wasn’t just about the numbers on his HUD—it was the gnawing fear that he’d let her get hurt. Before, it had been easier to think in terms of strategy. Now, every moment in the dungeon felt personal. Every risk she took made something deep in him tighten.. No instant recovery. No backup reserves. He’d always been careful with his resources, but he’d let something else take priority this time—an instinct that had worked against him.

She trusted him to heal her when needed.

And he needed to trust her to take the hits she could afford.

They pressed forward, the dungeon shifting as they advanced. The sound of water grew louder, but the path remained deceptively dry, the stone beneath them slick but stable. Raven moved first, scouting ahead while Luke followed at a measured pace, keeping his senses tuned for any sign of movement.

A ripple formed in a pool to their left. Then another. The surface broke as three constructs rose at once—water surging upward into humanoid forms, their translucent bodies flickering between solid and liquid states.

Raven didn’t hesitate.

She surged forward, closing the distance before the constructs could fully take shape. Her daggers gleamed as she twisted between them, each movement drawing more of that shifting aura around her. Her Flow pulsed, adjusting to the rhythm of the fight, and Luke could see it now—the way she used each close call, each dodge, to build momentum.

One of the constructs lashed out, and this time, Luke held his breath instead of his staff.

Raven leaned with the attack instead of avoiding it completely, letting the impact glance off her side before she pivoted into a counterstrike. Luke’s HUD flared: Minor Injury (Ribs). No Impairment.

He exhaled slowly. He didn’t need to react. Not yet.

Another construct surged toward her, aiming a sweeping strike at her legs. She vaulted over the attack, landing on the creature’s back, driving her dagger down into its shifting core. Water exploded outward as it collapsed, dispersing into the air.

Luke tightened his grip. He had to make his mana count, but the more he watched, the more it hurt to hold back. Every time she let an attack graze her instead of dodging, a part of him tensed, bracing against the urge to fix it, to erase every scrape before it could linger. But that wasn’t trust. That was fear.

The remaining constructs pressed in, but Raven was already moving. One moment she was striking, the next she had pulled away, her shadowed aura building with each exchange. When she moved next, it was with deliberate force—daggers cutting through liquid bodies as she danced through the fight, every motion sharpening her advantage.

Luke watched for the right moment. Not every injury needed intervention. But if the wrong hit landed—

A construct reared back, water coiling along its arm like a whip, aiming for her exposed flank. Luke reacted, but this time, not with a full heal. Instead, he reached for Beacon of Hope, the low-cost barrier shimmering around Raven just as the strike landed. The impact splashed against the golden light, dulling the force without disrupting her motion.

She didn’t pause. Didn’t even acknowledge the shield. But she adjusted, her counterattack swift and efficient, as if trusting that he would handle his side of the fight as surely as she handled hers.

The last construct crumbled, leaving nothing but ripples across the surface of the pools.

Raven straightened, rolling one shoulder before she turned to him. “Better.”

Luke released a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. He wanted to believe this was getting easier, that he could detach enough to let her fight her way. But it wasn’t easy. Not when he cared this much. She wasn’t wrong.

They moved forward again, the lesson sinking into his bones. He didn’t have to prevent every hit.

Just the ones that mattered.

### Scene 3

The next chamber stretched wide, a cavernous space filled with still pools of dark water. The sound of slow, deliberate drips echoed from unseen heights above. Luke took it in with a measured breath, rolling his shoulders, forcing his body to ease out of the tension that had held it so tightly since they’d entered the dungeon.

Raven strode ahead, her boots skimming over the damp stone without hesitation. She was still riding the high of her Flow, the dark energy swirling at her edges in faint wisps. She glanced back at him, sharp-eyed, assessing—not for danger, but for him.

He managed a nod. She gave him a slight smirk before moving forward.

The final wave of constructs rose from the pools, taller than before, water cascading from their shifting forms as they advanced. This was the last push. Luke tightened his grip on his staff, but this time, he wasn’t bracing to correct every mistake before it happened. He was watching, assessing, waiting for the moments that truly needed him.

Raven moved through them like a blade through silk, dodging, weaving, taking only the hits she meant to take. And he let her.

A construct swung, catching her across the back—his HUD pulsed, registering **Moderate Injury (Back). Slight mobility reduction.** Luke took a breath. She was still moving, still in control. He didn’t reach for his mana.

Another strike came, but this time, she deflected it entirely, twisting into the attack and redirecting it with a vicious counter. The construct buckled, water sloshing over the ground as it collapsed.

She was handling it. Just like she said she would.

And then, the real danger—one of the constructs surged up behind her, its form shifting, hardening. A core strike. That one, she wouldn’t walk off.

Luke moved instinctively, casting Brilliant Mend just as the hit connected. His HUD registered: **Healing in Progress – Moderate Injury Recovery.** The glow of his magic wove through her, closing the wound gradually instead of forcefully. No overcorrection. No panic. Just enough.

Raven didn’t break stride, barely sparing a glance at him as she finished the fight. He exhaled. It felt different this time—less like a desperate need to keep her safe, more like a steadying presence, there when she truly needed it.

The final construct crumbled, leaving silence in its wake.

For the first time in this dungeon, Luke didn’t feel like he had barely survived keeping up with her. His pulse was steady, his mana reserves low but manageable. The constant edge of anxiety had dulled, not gone, but no longer suffocating.

Raven turned to him, flicking the water off her blades. “You didn’t freak out this time.”

Luke let out a breath, shaking his head. “Not as much, at least.”

Her smirk softened. “You’re getting there.”

He nodded, rolling his shoulders again, feeling the tension finally begin to unwind. “Yeah. I think I am.”

They stepped forward, side by side, further into the dungeon. There would be more fights, more lessons. But for now, this was enough.
