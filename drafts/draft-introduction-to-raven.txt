The apartment was quiet except for the soft hum of notifications lingering in the air. Dim lighting filtered through heavy curtains, casting long, angular shadows against the industrial decor. Exposed brick walls, steel beams, and dark furniture created an atmosphere of deliberate isolation—Raven’s chosen sanctuary, though today it felt more like a cage.

She sat at her desk, a sleek piece of metal and glass, illuminated by the faint glow of the System’s interface. Her crimson eyes skimmed the lines of text projected before her.

Result: Failure.
Payout: 300 credits.
Performance Rating: Suboptimal.

The words blurred together after a while, variations of the same thing she had seen countless times. A sigh escaped her lips as she flicked the notification aside, and it dissolved into nothingness. Another failed dive. Another reminder of the limits she couldn’t seem to surpass on her own.

Raven leaned back in her chair, letting the weight of her frustration settle on her chest. She drummed her gloved fingers on the edge of the desk, the rhythmic tapping a faint attempt to dispel her irritation. Yet the silence pressed against her ears, amplifying the noise in her head.

Her gaze drifted to her gear spread across the nearby bench. The sight of her armor—cloth imbued with shimmering silver runes along the seams—only deepened her restlessness. The twin daggers beside it gleamed under the soft light, their edges razor-sharp and flawless. Tools of precision and agility, perfectly suited for her class as a Night Dancer. And yet, they felt like props in an ongoing tragedy of mediocrity.

Raven stood, her chair scraping against the concrete floor. Crossing to the bench, she picked up one of the daggers and held it up to the light. The blade caught the faint glow of the room, throwing off a ghostly shimmer. She traced a finger along the edge, testing its sharpness. It was perfect, as always. Her equipment wasn’t the problem.

Placing the dagger back down, she reached for the raven-shaped pendant hanging around her neck. Her fingers closed around it instinctively, the cool weight pressing into her palm. The necklace had been a gift from her parents when she first declared her intentions to dive. “A reminder of courage and freedom,” they’d said.

She snorted softly at the memory, shaking her head. The necklace had been meant to inspire her, but these days it felt more like a mocking token of unfulfilled promises. Courage? Maybe. Freedom? Not so much.

Raven turned away from the bench and paced the room, her boots barely making a sound against the polished floor. The reports she had discarded earlier still lay scattered across her desk, glaring reminders of her inability to solo efficiently.

She stopped and leaned against the wall, letting her forehead rest against the cool brick surface. She hated feeling stuck. She had always prided herself on her independence, on her ability to charge headfirst into challenges without relying on anyone. But even she couldn’t deny the truth anymore—some barriers were impossible to overcome alone.

The thought grated against her pride, and she squeezed the pendant in her hand. It wasn’t just the diving. It was everything. The expectations, the failure to live up to her own standards, the endless weight of her family’s shadow looming over her.

The hum of a new System notification pulled her back to the present. She straightened and glanced toward the glowing interface. The screen now displayed a scrolling list of dungeon updates and classified ads. Her eyes flicked to the “Team Finder” section, her chest tightening at the sight.

She hovered a hand over the tab but hesitated. Admitting she needed help felt like admitting defeat. Yet, deep down, she knew she couldn’t keep going like this—not if she wanted to make real progress.

A sharp knock at the door startled her, shattering the fragile moment of introspection.

“Raven? Are you in there?”

Her mother’s voice was calm, but it carried the unmistakable firmness Raven had grown up with. She sighed, her irritation bubbling back to the surface.

“Yeah, I’m here,” she called out, but she didn’t move to open the door.

The interruption only added to her growing frustration. She let out a slow breath and turned back to her desk. The interface blinked softly, the “Team Finder” option still highlighted. For a long moment, she stared at it, the pull of her pride warring with the realization that she needed to change something.

Her hand drifted to the necklace again, her fingers tracing its edges. A quiet determination began to form beneath the layers of irritation. She wasn’t done yet. She couldn’t be.

“Courage and freedom,” she murmured under her breath, her voice steadying.

The sound of her mother’s knock still echoed faintly in her ears, but Raven let it fade into the background. There would be time for family obligations later. Right now, she needed to figure out her next step—and she wasn’t going to let anything stop her.
