## Chapter 20: The Morning After

### Scene 1: "The First Kiss" (Revised)
The quiet in the apartment stretched, thick with something unspoken.

Luke had been alone with Raven before—countless times. In dungeons, in the field, after long training sessions. But this was different. There was nothing else in their way. No imminent threat, no tactical discussion to keep their hands busy, no excuse to move apart.

Just this space—and them in it.

Raven stood by the window, arms loose at her sides, gaze flickering to his, then away.

The tension from earlier still clung to the air—the almost-moment in the crevasse. The heat of her against him, the way their movements had locked into perfect sync, the breathless way she had looked at him when the fight was over.

Luke exhaled slowly. "So… what now?"

Raven didn’t answer immediately. She tilted her head slightly, considering him the way she might analyze a new enemy—measuring the distance, the risk. Then, instead of speaking, she took a single step closer.

The air between them shifted.

It was subtle but undeniable, the kind of change that couldn’t be undone.

Luke felt it deep in his chest—not just attraction, but inevitability. A quiet understanding settling into place, as if they had already decided, already crossed this line without needing to say it out loud.

His fingers twitched at his sides, his pulse kicking up as he mirrored her movement, closing the remaining space between them.

Close. Too close.

The warmth of her skin, the faint trace of iron from the fight, the sharper scent of adrenaline still clinging to her—it hit him before her lips did. And then there was just heat.

They moved at the same time.

It wasn’t careful. It wasn’t measured. It just happened.

Her hands slid up his chest, fingers curling against his collar. His found her waist, pulling her just a fraction closer as their lips met—a soft press at first, hesitant, almost testing. But then Raven exhaled into him, and Luke’s restraint shattered.

The kiss deepened, sharp and fast, like stepping off a ledge before he could second-guess it. Raven never did anything halfway, and this was no exception—her grip tightened, her body pressing against his as if demanding more. Luke responded instinctively, hands sliding up her back, steadying her, grounding them both.

For a moment, there was nothing else.

No dungeons. No fights. No past hesitations.

Just this. Just her.

When they finally pulled back, their breaths mingling, Luke saw something rare in Raven’s expression—not confidence, not deflection. Just quiet, certain understanding.

Her lips curled slightly, voice rougher than usual. "That took long enough."

Luke let out a short, breathless laugh, forehead still close to hers. "Yeah," he murmured. And for the first time in a long time, he didn’t feel like he was bracing for the fall.

Neither of them moved away. Not yet.

### Scene 2: "Morning After Chaos" (Revised)
The smell of coffee filled the kitchen, warm and grounding. Raven leaned against the counter, Luke’s robe draped loosely over her frame, the sleeves a little too long. She curled her fingers around the mug, savoring the quiet moment, the slow rhythm of morning settling in her bones.

Then—

A loud thud against the apartment door.

"Luke! I’m home a day early!" Anna’s voice rang through the hallway before the door even opened.

Raven took a slow sip of her coffee. Oh, this was about to get interesting.

The door swung open, and Anna burst in, half out of breath from hauling her bag inside. She looked up—expecting Luke, clearly.

Her eyes landed on Raven instead.

Silence.

A blink. Then another.

Raven raised an eyebrow, smirking slightly. "You’re not Luke."

Anna, to her credit, recovered fast. "You’re not Anna."

"Hi, I’m Raven." She set her mug down, extending a hand. "And I really hope you’re Anna."

Behind her, Luke finally stepped into the room, coffee mug halfway to his lips. He took in the scene—Raven, in his robe. Anna, smirking like she’d won some unspoken bet.

He exhaled slowly.

"I need stronger coffee."

Anna barely contained her grin. "Oh my God, this is amazing." Then, without missing a beat, she turned to Luke. "I thought you were gonna die alone."

Luke pinched the bridge of his nose. "Morning, Anna."

Anna’s eyes lit up as she turned back to Raven. "You have to tell me everything."

Raven smirked. "Funny. I could say the same."

Anna grinned, already dragging her bag inside. "Oh, this is gonna be so much fun."

Luke sighed. He was never getting that quiet morning back, was he?
