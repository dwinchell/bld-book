### **Sene: "What Was I Thinking?"**  
(*Raven processes Luke’s rejection and shuts down emotionally.*)  

---

Raven walked.  

Not toward anywhere in particular—just *away*.  

Her boots hit the pavement in sharp, steady beats, matching the rhythm of the words still looping in her head.  

*"Find someone else."*  

She clenched her jaw, ignoring the way her stomach twisted.  

She shouldn’t care. It shouldn’t **matter**.  

Jumping into something impossible? That was just what she did. She didn’t hesitate. She didn’t ask permission. She didn’t need **someone else** to be ready before she moved.  

So why had she asked him?  

She had **offered him her trust**, and he’d refused it.  

*"This isn’t about trust. It’s about survival."*  

But wasn’t it?  

Wasn’t **that exactly what it was about?**  

The thought scraped against her ribs, raw and sharp. She could still *see* him—arms crossed, brow furrowed, gaze locked on her like she was a problem to be solved instead of someone standing right in front of him, saying, *Come with me. I want you beside me.*  

And he had said **no**.  

Like she was reckless. Like she was *just* chasing a thrill. Like she hadn’t just done something completely out of character—offering not just a challenge, but **a place beside her**.  

Like she hadn’t just—  

She sucked in a breath, turned a corner too sharply, nearly collided with a guy carrying a bag of takeout. He muttered something, but she barely heard him.  

Her body still buzzed, adrenaline twisting under her skin, like she’d just made a **miscalculation** and was still waiting for the impact.  

She had expected risk. She had expected difficulty.  

What she hadn’t expected was the sharp, hollow feeling of hearing *no* and realizing—  

**She’d given him a choice, and he’d made it.**  

Raven flexed her fingers, shaking off the tension.  

Fine.  

She’d gotten her answer.  

Luke wasn’t **her** problem anymore.
