### Scene - Paperwork

The dungeon portal shimmered in front of her, swirling blue and endless, another run waiting. Raven leaned against the steel railing, arms crossed, her mind already moving ahead.  

She turned to Luke. *"Are we really doing this?"*  

He didn’t answer right away. Just watched her, like he was waiting for the real question underneath.  

*"The guild?"* he finally asked.  

She gave him a sideways glance. *“No, the part where I let you handle paperwork.”*  

Luke huffed a short laugh. *"It’s a good idea, Raven. And we’re doing it."*  

She exhaled through her nose, tapping a finger absently against the railing. *"I just hate paperwork."*  

*"I’ll do the paperwork."*  

She turned toward him fully, shifting her weight, considering that for a moment. Then she smiled—slow and easy, something amused at the edges.  

*"So, you’re guildmaster then."*  

Luke blinked. *"No—no, you’re the charismatic socialite."*  

Raven tipped her head, giving him a look. Not a challenge, not exactly. Something quieter. *Are we really doing this?*  

*"Okay, co-leads then,"* she said.  

And before he could answer, she kissed him.  

It wasn’t grand or dramatic—just **simple and final, a punctuation mark on the conversation.**  

She pulled away before he could react, already pivoting on her heel.  

The dungeon queue called.  

Behind her, Luke finally managed, **"...Wait."**  

Raven smirked to herself.  


### Scene: The First Lesson

The dungeon portal shimmered, its swirling blue depths casting faint light over the staging area floor. The nervous Night Dancer from before stood at its edge, shifting from foot to foot, hands gripping his daggers too tight. He glanced at Raven, hesitant.  

*"Are we actually going to run a dungeon together?"*  

Raven adjusted her gloves, rolling her shoulders. *"No."*  

The kid blinked. *"Wait—what?"*  

She turned to face him fully, tilting her head just slightly. *"You're running solo. I’ll just be there."*  

He went pale. **Not hesitation—fear.** But then, slowly, he squared his shoulders.  

*"Oh."* He swallowed hard. *"Okay."*  

Raven nodded, approving.  

Then, as he turned toward the portal, she spoke again, **evenly, no softness to it**—just the truth.  

*"Soloing will make you good."*  

He looked at her again, eyes flicking with uncertainty.  

*"Duoing will make you great."*  

She let that settle before adding, *"But you have to be strong on your own, or you bring nothing to the team."*  

His grip on his daggers tightened again, this time for the right reasons.  

Raven met his gaze, **flat, steady.**  

*"No support will run with you if they can’t trust you to hold your own."*  

The kid gave a shaky nod. But it wasn’t the same as before—it wasn’t doubt. It was **resolve.**  

She smirked. *“Let’s go.”*  

And with that, she stepped into the portal.  

The kid followed.
