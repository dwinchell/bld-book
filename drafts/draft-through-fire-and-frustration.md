## Chapter: Through Fire and Frustration

### Scene: Off Beat

The dungeon rumbled beneath their feet, the heat pressing in from all sides. Molten rivers cut through the shattered remains of ancient stone corridors, illuminating the oppressive darkness with an eerie, flickering glow. The air smelled of sulfur and scorched rock. Every step sent a crackle of heat through Luke’s boots, the warmth radiating upward like an unspoken challenge.

It wasn’t just the environment that felt off. **They** were off.

Luke sidestepped, narrowly avoiding a jet of flame bursting from the wall. He caught sight of Raven darting ahead, too fast, too reckless. She struck down a fireborn wraith with fluid precision, but she had pushed forward without waiting for him to cover her. Again.

He gritted his teeth. “Slow down—”

A sudden impact sent him stumbling back. A molten beast, half-formed from liquid rock, slammed its fist where he had just stood. The heat of it singed the air, forcing him to throw up a barrier of radiant light. The golden shield cracked under the pressure.

“Luke?” Raven’s voice cut through the din, sharp, but not alarmed. She was already moving, already pivoting back toward him, her daggers flashing as she carved through the creature’s side. “You good?”

He exhaled, dropping the barrier and rolling his shoulders. “Yeah.”

But he wasn’t. Not really.

Their rhythm was wrong. Their movements didn’t align the way they usually did. He was missing his CC windows. She was overextending. They were working harder for the same fights they should have been breezing through.

The heat wasn’t helping. The frustration gnawed at the edges of his patience, and when Raven spun away from him again—too soon, too careless—something in him snapped.

“Raven, wait!”

She didn’t. She was already launching herself into the next group of enemies, her body a blur of shadow and steel.

Luke cursed under his breath and charged after her.

### Scene: Rehashing the Fight

The moment the last enemy hit the ground, Raven turned on him, eyes sharp with irritation. "What the hell was that?"

Luke yanked his staff free from the molten husk of a fallen beast and planted it against the ground, exhaling hard. "What was *what*, exactly? The part where I had to cover you again because you keep diving in before I’m ready?"

Raven scoffed, shoving her daggers back into their sheaths. "If I wait every time for you to set up, I lose momentum. You know how I fight. I can’t stand around waiting for permission."

Heat rolled off the scorched stone beneath them, but Luke barely noticed. His patience was already fraying, and the conversation was already too familiar. "And if you keep pushing ahead without letting me control the fight, I *can’t* keep up. You’re taking unnecessary hits, I’m burning more mana than I should, and we’re dragging fights longer than they need to be."

She crossed her arms. "I know my limits. I *don’t* need you to micromanage me."

"And I don’t need you making me waste spells to fix your recklessness!"

The words came sharp, unfiltered, and they both stilled for a beat—breathing hard, the heat between them no longer just from the dungeon.

Raven’s eyes narrowed. "Oh, so now I’m a *problem* you need to fix?"

Luke exhaled, dragging a hand through his hair. "That’s not what I meant. And you know it."

She shook her head, pacing a tight line. "No, actually, I *don’t* know, because we’ve had this fight *before*, Luke. We already worked this out. You learned to trust me. I learned to let you set the pace when it mattered. So why are we *here* again?"

His jaw clenched. "Because something is *off*. You feel it too."

She fell silent at that. Just for a second. And that second was long enough for him to catch the flicker of something in her expression—something unsettled.

Then, just as fast, it was gone. "Doesn’t matter. We’re fine."

They weren’t. But neither of them seemed willing to be the first to say it.

The air between them was too thick, too charged. They were both *too* tense, *too* frustrated, and the words weren’t getting them anywhere. Just rehashing the same fight with no new answers.

Luke rolled his shoulders, took a breath, and made a decision.

"Wanna fight about it?"

Raven cocked her head, cautious. "What?"

He lowered his staff slightly, stance shifting just enough to be a challenge. "You’re on edge. I’m on edge. Talking isn’t getting us anywhere. So let’s settle it another way."

For a moment, she just studied him. Then, slowly, her lips curled into something sharp, dark amusement flickering behind her eyes. "You sure?"

Luke felt the fire in his blood now, but it was different—controlled. Measured. "Yeah."

Raven took a step forward, unsheathing her daggers with a flick of her wrists. "Alright then, healer. Let’s see if you can keep up."

And then she lunged.

### Scene: The Final Exchange

Raven came at him fast, pressing the attack without hesitation. This was frustration given form—sharp, relentless, demanding. Her blades blurred in the firelight, her strikes carrying the weight of words unsaid. Luke barely had time to block, his staff catching the flat of one dagger just before the second flicked toward his ribs. He twisted, but not fast enough—her next strike grazed the fabric of his sleeve, stopping a breath away from flesh. 

She could have cut him. She could have ended this. 

But she didn’t.

Instead, she shifted, exhaling hard as she stepped back into a defensive stance, chest rising and falling with exertion. The edge in her stance softened, and for the first time since the fight began, she hesitated—not in uncertainty, but in resolution. She had spent her anger, poured it into every strike, and now she was done.

She was giving him his turn.

Luke rolled his shoulders, adjusting his grip. Fine. 

His staff swung low, forcing her back. He pressed again, faster this time, testing her guard with deliberate, measured strikes. Her daggers met each one, her footwork precise, balanced. She wasn’t retreating. She was **watching.** Studying him. 

Luke struck high. She caught it clean, crossing her daggers to absorb the force, sparks flaring between them. His next attack came at an angle, forcing her to pivot—just slightly, just enough that he saw it: the first flicker of a smirk at the corner of her lips. 

She was enjoying this now. 

The fight slowed, shifting into something else. Every clash was a question, every block an answer. They weren’t fighting anymore. They were **learning each other again.**

Luke feinted left, then twisted right, catching her off guard. She recovered fast, but not fast enough. He stepped in, pressing the advantage, forcing her to brace as he brought his staff down hard. Her daggers locked together, catching the blow above them. 

They held there, locked together, muscles straining in the flickering light.

Their breathing synced. Close. **Too close.**

The heat between them wasn’t just from the embers swirling around them now. It was in the way her pupils dilated, the way his pulse thrummed in his throat. The firelight caught on sweat-dampened skin, the flicker of shadow and light turning everything gold and dark and **charged.**

Neither of them moved. Neither of them spoke.

Then Raven shifted, just slightly. A feint, but this time not for the fight. Her stance softened, her weight shifting, inviting him forward—**playful now, teasing.**

Luke exhaled sharply, something unspoken breaking loose in his chest. He responded without thinking, throwing a flurry of strikes that she deflected effortlessly, her dodges smooth, almost lazy. She grinned outright, dipping under his guard just to flick the flat of a dagger against his ribs—a ghost of a hit, more a taunt than an attack.

He barked out a breath of laughter despite himself, adjusting his stance, and she mirrored it with a knowing tilt of her head. **The fight was over.** Whatever they had needed from it, they had already taken.

The firelight crackled around them, but neither moved. The moment stretched, thick with something neither of them was quite ready to name.

### Scene: After the Flames

The last embers of their fight cooled, fading into the molten rivers that ran through the dungeon’s shattered corridors. Neither of them moved at first, breaths still uneven, muscles still thrumming with the echoes of motion. The fire between them—both real and unspoken—had burned itself down to something steadier, something quiet.

Luke rolled his shoulders, grounding himself, forcing the tension in his body to ease. The shift between them was palpable. The fight had stripped away the edges of their frustration, melted it down into something cleaner, more refined. **Understanding.**

Raven was watching him, but there was no challenge in her eyes now, no defiance. Just something considering, like she was still parsing what had just happened between them. Then, with the same ease she carried into battle, she turned and strode toward the next section of the dungeon.

Luke fell in step beside her. There was no need to speak, no need to acknowledge what had shifted between them. Whatever had happened, whatever had settled, it didn’t need words. Not yet.

The next fight unfolded differently. Not easier, not slower, but **smoother.** His heals landed with precision, not just restoring her but **offering reassurance**, reinforcing what they had already built. His barriers came up in time with her dodges, not just protecting her but **standing with her.** When she pulled enemies toward them, it no longer felt like impatience—it felt like **an invitation, a promise to stand together.**

When she taunted a creature off of him, it didn’t feel like defiance—it felt like **a protective embrace, fierce and unyielding.**

The spaces between them narrowed and expanded in a rhythm neither had to think about anymore. No second-guessing, no catching up, no overcompensating.

It wasn’t just efficiency. It was instinct.

They moved through the rest of the dungeon like that—flowing instead of forcing, adjusting instead of reacting. There were no arguments, no hesitations. Just **them.**

The final boss fell with an almost anticlimactic ease. A creature of obsidian and fire, its molten form cracking apart under the weight of their combined assault. It let out one last guttural sound before shattering into embers, its energy dissipating into the walls.

Silence settled in the aftermath. The fight was over. The dungeon was done.

Raven turned first, summoning the return portal. The soft, pulsing glow of it cut through the dungeon’s fiery hues, a cool contrast to everything that had come before.

She glanced at him, unreadable for half a second, then stepped through.

Luke hesitated, feeling the shift between them settle into something unspoken but undeniable. Then, steady this time, he followed

### Scene: Stolen Words

The afterglow of battle still clung to Raven’s skin, a charged hum beneath her pulse as she stepped out of the dungeon portal. The weight of the run was settling in—not exhaustion, but something deeper. She flexed her fingers, shaking out the last remnants of tension as the staging area’s familiar surroundings took shape around them.

Luke materialized beside her, rolling one shoulder before lifting his hand to summon the spoils of their victory. Light shimmered in his palm, swirling in a delicate spiral before solidifying into fabric—a cloak woven from the same wind-infused magic that had filled the dungeon, its edges flickering like mist caught in a current.

Interesting.

Before he could so much as blink, Raven plucked it neatly from his grasp.

Luke’s hand froze mid-air. He blinked at the empty space where the cloak had been. Then at her.

“Really?”

Raven held it up, inspecting the weave with obvious amusement. “It suits me.”

Luke exhaled, irritation flickering across his face as he dragged a hand down it. “Raven—”

“You’re a healer,” she mused, turning it over in her hands. “I’m the one who actually dodges things.”

She tossed the cloak over her shoulders, rolling them slightly to let the fabric settle. Light, flexible, perfect.

Luke stared at her. Then pinched the bridge of his nose. “I love you, but that’s not how loot works.”

The words had barely left his mouth before he froze.

Raven went utterly still. A beat passed, just long enough for the weight of what he had said to crash down between them. His expression shifted—a rare, genuine flicker of panic. Then he made a noise in his throat, somewhere between a cough and an aborted attempt to fix the situation. “I llllllike you but—”

Raven arched a slow, dangerous eyebrow. “Say that first part again.”

Luke looked stricken, his frustration over the cloak momentarily forgotten as real panic set in. “I—” He exhaled sharply, shoulders dropping in defeat. “That’s not how I meant to tell you—”

She smiled, tilting her head as she adjusted the cloak. “Mm-hmm.”

Silence stretched between them, but it wasn’t like the dungeon’s—it wasn’t void, or stolen, or uncertain. It was something else entirely, something hanging between them, waiting to be acknowledged.

Then Raven, ever so casually, said, “Love you too.”

She pressed a quick kiss to his cheek before stepping back, adjusting the cloak with a satisfied flick. “Keeping this, though.”

Luke let out a breath, relief flickering across his features. Then he shook his head, and the joy was quickly replaced by renewed annoyance. He ran a hand through his hair, muttering, “Yeah. Figured.”
