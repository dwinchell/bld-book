Raven found Luke where she expected him—leaning against the edge of a railing, sipping from a cheap paper cup. The late afternoon sun slanted through the gaps in the concrete, casting long shadows across the quiet staging area.

She stepped up beside him, elbows brushing. He didn’t startle, just glanced her way and tipped his cup toward her in silent greeting.

No preamble. No circling around it. That wasn’t her style.

"Run the Radiant Spire with me."

Luke stilled.

The cup paused at his lips, but he didn’t drink. His brows pulled together, and when he turned to face her fully, there was a look in his eyes she couldn’t quite place.

Disbelief? No—something closer to concern.

"You’re not serious," he said.

Raven folded her arms. "Why wouldn’t I be?"

Luke exhaled sharply through his nose, shaking his head. "Because it’s the Radiant Spire, Raven. It’s a death trap. No one’s ever cleared it. The people who’ve tried barely survived."

"That’s why I want to do it."

He stared at her like she’d lost her mind. "That’s not a reason."

"It is to me."

Luke set his drink down on the railing, rubbing a hand over his face like he was physically trying to scrub the conversation away. He was tense now, his shoulders wound tight, and she didn’t understand why.

"No," he said. "Absolutely not."

The sharp finality of it made something twist in her chest.

"Luke—"

"You’re chasing something impossible just because it’s impossible." His voice was rising now, edged with something she couldn’t name. "You think if you just throw yourself at it hard enough, it’ll work out. That’s not how this goes."

She blinked, thrown off by the sudden shift. He wasn’t just refusing—he was angry.

"You don’t think we could do it?" she asked, trying to keep her voice even.

"I think it’s reckless."

The word hit.

Reckless.

That’s what he thought this was. That’s what he thought she was.

Her throat felt tight. She forced her arms to stay folded, to keep her stance loose, unaffected. "So what, you just don’t trust me?"

Luke let out a breath, frustrated. "This isn’t about trust. It’s about survival."

But wasn’t it?

Wasn’t that exactly what this was about?

Her stomach dropped, because she saw it now.

He didn’t understand.

This wasn’t about the challenge. It wasn’t about the credits or the leaderboard or proving anything to anyone.

This was her offering something real.

And he didn’t see it.

Didn’t even consider it.

"I won’t be part of it," Luke said, voice firm.

The words sliced through her, cleaner than any blade.

He could have said anything else—could have told her they weren’t ready, could have asked her why, could have looked at her long enough to figure it out—but he didn’t. He shut her down.

And then, because he hadn’t already driven the knife in deep enough—

"Find someone else."

Raven felt her body go still.

Luke must have seen something change in her face, because he hesitated—but it was too late.

The damage was done.

She let the silence stretch, made him sit in it. Then, finally, she gave him a sharp, humorless smile.

"Got it."

She turned and walked away before he could say another word.
