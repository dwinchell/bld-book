Anna was already waiting on the couch when Luke walked in, legs tucked beneath her, flipping through the notebook she always carried.

"Finally." She snapped it shut and grinned up at him. "You took forever. Please tell me you stopped for snacks."

"No."

"Unbelievable. You expect me to survive spring break at home with no snacks?" She sighed dramatically. "Whatever. What’s up with you? You look like you got hit by a truck."

"I don’t look like that."

"Luke, you look like a sad cartoon dog. What happened?"

Luke hesitated, but there was no escaping this. Anna would wear him down like water against rock if he didn’t just tell her.

"Raven asked me to run the Radiant Spire with her."

Anna blinked. "The what?"

"A dungeon."

"Yeah, I figured. But why do you look like she asked you to help her commit tax fraud?"

Luke exhaled sharply and leaned against the counter. "It’s not just any dungeon. No one’s ever cleared it. Barely anyone’s even survived it."

Anna raised an eyebrow. "So... it’s a bad idea?"

"An insane idea. It’s built for two people, but it doesn’t just scale difficulty—it tests coordination. You have to be completely in sync with your partner. If you screw up, you die. If you don’t trust each other completely, you fail."

Anna frowned slightly, twirling a loose thread from her sweater. "That’s... weirdly specific."

Luke shrugged. "It’s brutal. Every step has to be in sync. Every fight, every movement. There’s no saving each other—you live or die together."

Anna stared at him for a long moment, then tilted her head. "And she asked you to do it with her."

Luke hesitated.

"Did she say why?"

"No," he muttered.

"Huh." Anna tapped her fingers against her notebook. "And you didn’t think to ask?"

Luke frowned. "I told her it was reckless. Which it is."

"Uh-huh." Anna gave him a knowing look.

Luke sighed. "I told her to find someone else."

A pause.

Anna’s expression shifted, like she’d just watched him trip and fall down a flight of metaphorical stairs.

"Oh, Luke."

"What?"

"You moron."

Luke scowled. "How is that—"

"Do you really think she would’ve asked just anyone?"

Luke opened his mouth. Closed it.

Anna let that silence stretch. Then, gently:

"She wasn’t just asking you to run a dungeon."

The knot in his stomach twisted.

"She was asking if you trusted her."

Luke exhaled through his nose, staring down at the counter.

"She was asking if you wanted to do something impossible with her," Anna continued. "Not just because it was hard, but because it meant something."

And he’d told her no. He’d called it reckless. He’d told her to find someone else.

Oh.

Oh.

Anna sighed and stretched, standing up. "Welp. You have fun figuring that out. I’m gonna go make a grilled cheese."

Luke barely heard her.

He was already grabbing his phone.
