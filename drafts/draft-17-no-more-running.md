## Chapter: No More Running

### Scene 1: What did you do?

Anna was already waiting on the couch when Luke walked in, legs tucked beneath her, flipping through the notebook she always carried.

"Finally." She snapped it shut and grinned up at him. "You took forever. Please tell me you stopped for snacks."

"No."

"Unbelievable. You expect me to survive spring break at home with no snacks?" She sighed dramatically. "Whatever. What’s up with you? You look like you got hit by a truck."

"I don’t look like that."

"Luke, you look like a sad cartoon dog. What happened?"

Luke hesitated, but there was no escaping this. Anna would wear him down like water against rock if he didn’t just tell her.

"Raven asked me to run the Radiant Spire with her."

Anna blinked. "The what?"

"A dungeon."

"Yeah, I figured. But why do you look like she asked you to help her commit tax fraud?"

Luke exhaled sharply and leaned against the counter. "It’s not just any dungeon. No one’s ever cleared it. Barely anyone’s even survived it."

Anna raised an eyebrow. "So... it’s a bad idea?"

"An insane idea. It’s built for two people, but it doesn’t just scale difficulty—it tests coordination. You have to be completely in sync with your partner. If you screw up, you die. If you don’t trust each other completely, you fail."

Anna frowned slightly, twirling a loose thread from her sweater. "That’s... weirdly specific."

Luke shrugged. "It’s brutal. Every step has to be in sync. Every fight, every movement. There’s no saving each other—you live or die together."

Anna stared at him for a long moment, then tilted her head. "And she asked you to do it with her."

Luke hesitated.

"Did she say why?"

"No," he muttered.

"Huh." Anna tapped her fingers against her notebook. "And you didn’t think to ask?"

Luke frowned. "I told her it was reckless. Which it is."

"Uh-huh." Anna gave him a knowing look.

Luke sighed. "I told her to find someone else."

A pause.

Anna’s expression shifted, like she’d just watched him trip and fall down a flight of metaphorical stairs.

"Oh, Luke."

"What?"

"You moron."

Luke scowled. "How is that—"

"Do you really think she would’ve asked just anyone?"

Luke opened his mouth. Closed it.

Anna let that silence stretch. Then, gently:

"She wasn’t just asking you to run a dungeon."

The knot in his stomach twisted.

"She was asking if you trusted her."

Luke exhaled through his nose, staring down at the counter.

"She was asking if you wanted to do something impossible with her," Anna continued. "Not just because it was hard, but because it meant something."

And he’d told her no. He’d called it reckless. He’d told her to find someone else.

Oh.

Oh.

Anna sighed and stretched, standing up. "Welp. You have fun figuring that out. I’m gonna go make a grilled cheese."

Luke barely heard her.

He was already writing a System message to Raven.

### Scene 2: "Denied at the Door"

Luke had never been to the Blackwood estate before.

It wasn’t the kind of place you stumbled across—not tucked away in some gated community or perched atop a hill like the estates of lesser families who wanted to flaunt their wealth.

No, the Blackwood estate sat deep in the city, hidden in plain sight, a monolith of old money and quiet power.

The kind of place that didn’t need to announce itself.

Luke adjusted his jacket as he stepped up to the front entrance, exhaling slowly as he hit the intercom.

There was a pause, then a smooth, professional voice came through.

"Blackwood estate."

"I need to speak to Raven."

Another pause. Then—"Name?"

"Luke Calloway."

The intercom went silent.

Then the front doors opened.

That was almost more unsettling than being told to leave.

Luke stepped inside, immediately aware of the shift in atmosphere. The estate wasn’t ostentatious—no towering chandeliers or obnoxious displays of wealth—but everything was deliberate. The polished floors, the elegant yet restrained decor, the way the air felt just a little heavier, like the house itself was considering him.

And at the center of it all stood Grant Blackwood.

Luke had seen him in news interviews before—heard his name in the same breath as political figures and industry titans. But meeting him in person was different.

Grant Blackwood wasn’t just powerful. He was imposing, in a way that had nothing to do with his height or build. It was the way he carried himself, the sheer weight of his presence.

"Mr. Calloway," Grant said, tone warm but measured. "What an unexpected surprise."

Luke didn’t waste time.

"I need to see Raven."

Grant smiled. Not the amused kind, not the kind that meant yes.

The kind that meant this conversation was already over.

"Ah." Grant folded his hands behind his back. "I’m afraid that won’t be possible."

Luke exhaled sharply through his nose. "I just need five minutes."

"She’s unavailable."

Luke didn’t believe that for a second.

"I just need to talk to her."

"And yet," Grant said, with the kind of effortless dismissal only a man who controlled entire sectors of the economy could manage, "you won’t be."

Luke clenched his jaw.

This was a power play. A polite, calculated wall being built in real time.

And Luke was rapidly running out of ways through it.

He weighed his next move carefully. If he pushed too hard, Grant would shut the door permanently. If he backed off, he’d never get past this foyer.

He had to get Grant to slip. Just once.

So he did the only thing he could.

He lied.

Luke exhaled slowly, shifting his stance like he was conceding. Like he was backing down.

"Alright. Just tell her I’ll be heading out, then."

Grant’s expression didn’t change, but Luke caught it—the smallest flicker of something.

A hesitation.

Because if Raven wasn’t here, Grant would have just said I’ll let her know when she returns.

But he hadn’t.

Luke had given him an out—and he hadn’t taken it.

She was home.

Grant knew it. And now, so did Luke.

Luke nodded once. "Thanks for your time, Mr. Blackwood."

Then he turned and walked right back out the door.

### Scene 3: "Breaking and Entering"

Luke stood outside the Blackwood estate, assessing his options.

Grant had turned him away. That had been expected.

What Grant hadn’t done was deny that Raven was home.

Which meant Luke just needed to find her himself.

He scanned the upper floors, his eyes catching on a single window.

Unlike the others, this one had blackout curtains, drawn tight against the city glow. It stood out—too private, too intentional, too obviously hers.

Found you.

Luke took a breath, then moved.

The climb wasn’t difficult, but it was a hell of a risk. He scaled the side carefully, testing handholds, gripping stone and ledges where he could, ignoring the part of his brain that reminded him that this was, technically, breaking and entering.

At the window, he tested the latch.

Locked.

Of course.

He clenched his jaw, then punched through a small pane of glass.

The muffled crack shattered the quiet night, shards falling to the floor inside. He reached in, unlatched the lock, and eased the window open.

A rush of cool air met him as he poked his head inside—

—then yanked it back immediately as something whizzed past his ear.

A dull thud.

A sharp metallic hum.

Luke brushed a severed lock of hair off his nose.

That better have been a warning shot.

He exhaled, then dove through the window.

A rush of shadows—then cold steel at his throat.

"It’s me," he said, voice low, unmoving.

"I know," Raven replied.

A beat of silence.

The air between them was thick—with tension, with expectation, with the undeniable fact that she’d reacted before she’d even identified him.

She had no hesitation when it came to striking.

Which meant she’d chosen not to strike now.

He watched her in the dim light, his pulse settling. Close quarters, familiar territory.

Finally, she lowered the knife, stepping back.

Then—a shove.

Not hard. Not rough. Just enough.

Luke barely resisted a smirk as he straightened.

He turned to look at her, and—

She was surprising a smile.

It was small, just the ghost of amusement, but it was there.

The gambit had worked.

Then, just as quickly, her expression shut down.

She exhaled sharply, shoulders tightening, and turned away.

"Go home, Luke."

Luke’s smirk faded.

"Not until we talk."

"We already did." Her voice was quieter now. More controlled.

"Not properly."

She didn’t move.

For a moment, he thought she might let this play out. Might let the tension settle, might give him a chance.

Then—

"You made your choice."

Her voice was still quiet. But sharp.

"Go home."

Luke exhaled.

This wasn’t going to be easy.

But he wasn’t leaving.

Not this time.

### Scene 4: "A Different Kind of Leap"
Luke had never been good with words.

Not the ones that mattered.

But standing here, in Raven’s room, facing what he’d done, he knew there wasn’t a way around it. No clever approach, no second attempt at the window gambit.

If he was going to fix this, he had to say it outright.

"I screwed up."

Raven didn’t respond.

She just watched him, standing by the edge of her desk, arms crossed, expression unreadable.

But she was listening.

So he kept going.

"I didn’t realize what you were really asking." His voice was steady—barely. "I didn’t take the time to understand. I just—" He exhaled, shaking his head. "I was scared."

Something flickered across her face—not surprise. She’d expected that.

"Yeah," she said. "Of the Spire. You made that pretty clear."

"No."

That made her pause.

Luke swallowed, forcing himself to hold her gaze. "Not just the Spire. That scared me, yeah. But the thing that really terrified me—the thing I didn’t even let myself see—was the thought of losing you."

Raven’s expression finally shifted, just slightly.

But she still didn’t speak.

"I didn’t let myself see it," he admitted. "Because I was also scared of getting too close." His voice was quieter now, but no less certain. "Scared of losing someone again."

Raven’s arms loosened slightly at her sides, but she didn’t move.

Didn’t close the distance.

Didn’t let him off the hook.

"And so I hesitated." Luke let out a breath, slow and careful. "And I lost you anyway."

The words landed heavier than he expected.

Because they were true.

"That’s why I’m here."

His chest felt tight, but he pressed forward.

"I’m asking for another chance."

Raven’s jaw shifted slightly, like she was biting something back.

And then she said, too evenly—

"I was afraid too."

Luke stilled.

Raven exhaled, and there it was.

Not sharp, not cutting—just honest.

"I was afraid of depending on you." She looked at him, and for the first time tonight, he saw not just frustration, not just hurt—but something deeper. "And I still took the leap."

Luke’s throat tightened.

She let that hang between them.

And he understood what she wasn’t saying.

She’d given him the chance to do the same.

And he hadn’t.

Silence stretched between them, thick and heavy with everything they hadn’t said before now.

Luke let it sit.

Then, finally—

"Run the Spire with me."

Raven’s gaze snapped to him.

The words had been steady, no hesitation. No second-guessing.

She searched his face, looking for something—and whatever she saw there made her shoulders tighten.

"Really?"

Luke’s next breath was slow, measured.

"Yes."

He took a step forward, the space between them smaller than it had been all night.

"Only those who fight in perfect harmony will survive," he said, voice even.

Raven blinked.

Luke didn’t stop.

"Only those who enter in perfect trust will live to see the end."

She knew those words.

She had read them a hundred times before, burned them into her memory, just like he had.

The Radiant Spire’s description.

The words that defined the entire challenge.

But now, they meant something else.

"I want that," he said, quiet but firm. "With you."

### Scene 5: "The Test"

The silence stretched between them.

Luke had asked. The words were still hanging in the air—*Run the Spire with me.* He had laid everything out. No hesitation this time. No fear. He had said what he wanted.

And Raven… hadn’t answered.

Not yet.

Instead, she looked away, as if considering, then—*"I already went back to solo diving."*

Luke didn’t react. Not immediately. Then—*"I saw."*

That got her attention. Her gaze flicked back to him, sharp. *"Were you worried?"*

He didn’t hesitate. *"Yes."*

Raven’s lips pressed together. Then, quietly, but with an edge—*"So you think I can’t go it alone."* A breath. *"That I need you."* Another beat. *"That I have to do this."*

It was a test.

Luke knew it the second the words left her mouth. Knew the shape of what she was asking, what she was really trying to measure with this conversation.

He didn’t answer right away. Not because he didn’t know what to say, but because it mattered—**how** he said it, **what** he gave her now. He had to get this right.

*"You know you'd be fine alone."*

She didn’t move, didn’t blink. Just **watched him**. Waiting.

He inhaled, steady, deliberate. *"But this isn’t about whether you *need* me. It’s about what we could be together."*

Something flickered across her face, but she didn’t speak. Not yet.

Luke took a step closer, voice quieter now, but firm. *"Keep solo diving if you want to. You don’t have to stop. But not every dive has to be one or the other."* He held her gaze. *"We can be together and separate. At different times. That’s what a relationship is."*

That made her **pause**. He could see it—the slight shift in her stance, the tension that had been coiled **just waiting for him to slip** starting to **ease**. But just a little.

*"I respect your independence,"* he said simply. *"I always have."*

That was it.

That was what she needed to hear.

Raven exhaled, something unreadable flickering in her expression before she looked down, her fingers curling slightly at her sides. Then, after a beat—

*"I still want to trust you."*

Luke nodded, no relief, no rush to close the space between them—just quiet understanding.

*"Then let’s earn it."*

### Scene 6: "Building the Path"

Luke took a breath, steady now. He had her attention, and that was enough. For now.

*"We do this right, Raven."* His voice was calm, measured. *"Not just the Spire. Us."*

She crossed her arms, still watching him carefully. *"And what does ‘right’ mean to you?"*

He glanced at her, tilting his head slightly. *"It means we don’t rush something we aren’t ready for. That we build trust, not assume it’s there just because we want it to be."*

Raven’s brows furrowed slightly, something guarded creeping back into her stance. *"You think I haven’t earned your trust?"*

Luke shook his head immediately. *"That’s not what I mean."* He hesitated, then continued. *"I looked up the list of survivors of the Spire."*

That got her attention. *"There are five. Twin siblings, a married couple of five years… and the guy who came out alone."*

Raven frowned, but Luke pressed on. *"The two couples were high-level divers. They knew their limits. They reached the Heart and decided they shouldn’t try to finish. That it was too much."*

She exhaled through her nose, arms still crossed. *"And the guy who came out alone?"*

Luke’s voice softened. *"His partner didn’t make it."*

Raven’s jaw tightened. She didn’t say anything, but he could see the gears turning behind her eyes.

*"The kind of trust I want to build with you takes time and effort. It means proving, over and over again, that the other person will get it right. It’s not just about ability—it’s about knowing when to push forward and when to stop."*

She held his gaze, unflinching. *"So what, you need me to pass some test?"*

He shook his head. *"No, Raven. I need us to build something neither of us can break."* He took another step forward. *"I know you thrive on chaos and adaptation. And you know I need to prepare. That’s the difference between us. But that doesn’t mean we can’t find a way to do this *together*."*

Her expression was unreadable now. Not cold. Not distant. Just… thinking.

Luke let out a slow breath. *"I want to do this the right way. Not just my way. Not just yours. The way we both agree is right."* He met her eyes. *"Can we do that?"*

Raven was quiet for a long moment, still processing, still weighing everything he had said. 

Then, finally—

*"Yes."*

### **Scene 7: "Negotiations and Consequences"**

Raven’s eyes met his, steady and unreadable. Then, finally—

*"Let’s do it."*

She didn’t move. Didn’t say anything else. The decision had been made, but something in her **still needed time to catch up to it.**

Luke understood. He exhaled, nodding once. 

*"Message me when you’re ready to talk?"* 

Raven gave a small nod, still lost in thought.

The moment hung between them, **heavy but no longer uncertain.**

Then Luke took a step back, rolling his shoulders. The tension in the air needed to break, and there was one easy way to do that—leaving. Preferably through the window, since that’s how he’d arrived.

He turned toward it, preparing to climb out, when—

*"Wait."*  

He paused, glancing back to see **Raven’s expression shift.** A **mischievous glint** flickered in her eyes. 

She tilted her head toward the door, voice light but unmistakably smug. *"My father might want to see you about the window."*  

Luke blinked. Then his stomach dropped. 

**Oh.**

A nervous sweat prickled at the back of his neck. *"You’re serious?"* 

Raven’s grin widened, **just slightly.** *"Call it a consequence."* 

He hesitated, looking between her and the window. He weighed his options. They weren’t good. 

*He should have made a better first impression on Raven’s father.*

With a sigh, he turned toward the door, muttering, *"You are actually evil."*

Raven hummed in amusement but didn’t deny it.

Luke descended the stairs carefully, **his mind already working through potential escape routes.**

But when he reached the sitting room, **Grant Blackwood was already waiting.**

Seated in an armchair, **reading a newspaper**, Grant didn’t acknowledge Luke’s presence at first. He simply turned a page, his movements **slow and deliberate**, exuding **impeccable poise.**

Without looking up, he spoke. *"I assume that went reasonably well?"*

Luke hesitated. **How much did Grant know?** 

*"Why’s that?"*

Grant folded his paper neatly, finally meeting Luke’s gaze. *"For the same reason I didn’t contact the police when I noticed you scaling the outside of my home."*

Luke made a hesitant sound, something between a cough and an awkward *"Uh..."* 

Grant set the paper aside, lacing his fingers together. **His tone was still light, still perfectly polite.**

*"Because if you hadn’t been welcome, you’d have more holes in you right now."*

Luke swallowed. *"She did throw a knife at my head."*

Grant’s expression didn’t change. *"Must have missed on purpose then."*

Luke let out a dry breath, rubbing the back of his neck. *"I took that as an encouraging sign."*

Grant was silent for a moment. Then, suddenly, he stood, his entire demeanor **shifting in an instant**—his reserved composure giving way to **grand theatricality.**

*"Well then!"* He clapped Luke on the shoulder, nearly making him stumble. *"I’ll see you out. Navigation clearly isn’t your strong suit, and I wouldn’t want a welcome guest to get lost."* He gestured grandly toward the hall. *"Come back anytime—anytime at all! Assuming Raven agrees, of course."*

Luke barely had time to process before Grant was **sweeping him toward the door**, his words **flowing with the smooth confidence of a man who always controlled the conversation.**

Luke opened his mouth, then closed it again. 

By the time they reached the front door, he wasn’t sure if he was being **politely escorted or casually evicted.**

Somehow, neither option made him feel better.
