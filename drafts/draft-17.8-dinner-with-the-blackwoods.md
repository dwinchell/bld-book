## Chapter: Dinner with the Blackwoods

### **Scene: "An Invitation Out of Nowhere"**

The post-dive exhaustion hadn't fully set in yet, but it was getting there. Luke could already feel the dull ache creeping into his limbs as they stepped out of the dungeon portal, the cold city air hitting them like a wall. 

Raven stretched, rolling out the tension in her shoulders. "Well, that wasn’t awful."

Luke shot her a tired look. "We got jumped by three elites at once. I had to pull you out of the rubble."

"And I survived," she said easily, as if that were the point. "Besides, you needed the challenge."

He huffed, but didn’t argue. She had a way of making victories sound like minor inconveniences.

They started walking toward the transit hub when Raven abruptly spoke again. "Come to dinner."

Luke blinked. "What?"

She didn’t look at him, just kept walking. "Dinner. At my parents’ place. Tonight."

He stopped short, which meant she took another few steps before realizing and turning back to face him, arms crossed. "What?"

"That’s—" He exhaled, trying to find the right words. "That’s a lot of information all at once."

"It’s just dinner, Luke. You eat, don’t you?"

"Yeah, but—" He gestured vaguely, as if that would help explain the sheer *magnitude* of this request. "Your *parents’?*"

She shrugged, but there was something calculated in the way she was watching him now. "They want to meet you. You’ve been my partner for months, and you didn’t completely embarrass yourself at the gala, so it makes sense."

That didn’t make sense. Not entirely. Not coming from *her.*

"Raven," he said carefully, "do you actually want me to come to this dinner? Or are you just doing it because it makes sense?"

For a moment, she didn’t answer. And that moment stretched *just* long enough for Luke to see the shift in her stance—not defensive, but considering. 

Then she sighed. "Wouldn’t have asked if I didn’t want you there."

His stomach did something complicated at that. He wasn’t sure he liked it.

"Okay," he said after a pause. "What’s the dress code?"

That got a smirk out of her. "Just try not to look like you crawled out of a battlefield."

Luke glanced down at his still-dusty armor and bloodstained sleeves. "I make no promises."

Raven laughed. "Dinner’s at seven. Don’t be late."

### **Scene: "At the Blackwood Estate"**

Luke stepped through the grand entrance of the Blackwood estate, adjusting the sleeves of his freshly cleaned shirt. The place was as imposing as he’d expected—ornate but not ostentatious, everything meticulously arranged, like it had been designed to command respect without needing to ask for it.

Raven led the way, her stride confident as ever. "Just relax. It’s dinner, not an inquisition."

"Easy for you to say," Luke muttered. "I didn’t break into this house two weeks ago."

Raven smirked but didn’t respond. She pushed open the dining room doors, revealing an elegantly set table with polished silverware and soft, ambient lighting.

Grant Blackwood sat at the head, posture perfect, exuding the same effortless authority as always. Beside him, Elaine Blackwood—Raven’s mother—stood gracefully as they entered. She smiled warmly at Luke, the kind of smile that felt practiced but not insincere.

"Luke, welcome," Grant said smoothly. "Please, take a seat. We’re glad to have you."

Luke hesitated for half a second before stepping forward and lowering himself into a chair. Raven took the seat beside him, her posture noticeably more relaxed than his.

"We’ve heard a great deal about you," Elaine said, passing him a dish. "Though, I must admit, I was expecting someone a bit more... cautious."

Luke managed a wry smile. "I like to think I balance out Raven’s approach."

Grant huffed in amusement, taking a sip of his wine. "That remains to be seen."

Raven shot her father a look. "Play nice."

Grant smiled in response, all charm and control. "Of course."

### **Scene: "The Blackwood Charm Offensive"**

Luke had just managed to settle into the rhythm of dinner when Elaine Blackwood’s voice, smooth as silk but laced with unmistakable amusement, cut through the conversation.

"So, Luke," she said, casually lifting her glass of wine. "I hear you broke into my daughter’s window. How did that work out for you?"

Luke froze mid-bite.

Raven, to his immediate left, went utterly still. He glanced at her, expecting some kind of intervention, but she was watching him with an expression that could only be described as *amused detachment*. Like a cat watching a mouse realize it had just stepped into a trap.

Oh God.

Elaine was still looking at him expectantly, eyebrows arched in polite curiosity.

Luke cleared his throat. "Um... good?"

Elaine hummed as though considering his response. "Good?" she echoed, drawing out the word in a way that made his skin prickle. "That’s all you have to say? Breaking into a high-profile estate, scaling walls, and smashing windows—and it was just *good*?"

Luke was starting to sweat. "I mean, technically, it was efficient—"

"Efficient!" Elaine laughed lightly, shaking her head. "Grant, did you hear that? Breaking and entering, *efficiently* executed."

Grant, who had been focused on cutting his steak, lifted his head with an air of casual amusement. "Mm, I did hear that. Rather bold of him, don’t you think?"

Luke risked another glance at Raven. *She was enjoying this.* *Oh no.*

Elaine, apparently unwilling to let him escape that easily, leaned in slightly, her smile growing. "You know, I can’t recall the last time someone climbed up to my daughter’s window. I’m trying to decide whether that’s romantic or just deeply concerning."

Luke opened his mouth, closed it, then, "Uh."

Raven took a slow sip of her drink, watching the scene unfold with *way* too much enjoyment. He was trapped.

*Oh God, there are two of them. Two Blackwood women and I’m completely doomed.*

Desperate, he turned to Grant, hoping for an improbable rescue.

Grant met his gaze and—**winked.**

Oh no.

"Well," Grant began, smoothly setting down his glass. "If we are to recount the tale properly, we must not diminish its grandeur. Picture, if you will, a young man, determined and fearless, braving the treacherous heights of Blackwood Manor in pursuit of something greater than himself."

Elaine coughed just as he was about to say *lovers*.

Grant continued undeterred, waving a hand theatrically. "With unparalleled daring, he scales the very walls that have stood firm for generations, his heart undeterred by the looming threat of security measures—"

"My security measures," Raven interjected, but she was smirking now.

"—until at last, he reaches his goal! And who should meet him but the fair lady herself, armed with her grace, her cunning—"

"A knife," Luke muttered.

Grant nodded approvingly. "Yes, *grace*, in its sharpest form. And yet, through fate’s design and my daughter’s *magnanimity*, he was allowed to continue his adventure, rather than being left to perish upon the cold marble floors. A generous gesture, truly."

Elaine was outright grinning now, and Raven, well—she looked entirely too pleased with herself.

Luke let out a slow breath and gave in, shaking his head. "I’m glad to know my suffering has been so entertaining for everyone."

Elaine lifted her glass in mock salute. "Oh, immensely."

### **Scene: "A More Comfortable Conversation"**

The laughter still lingered in the air as the conversation drifted into easier territory. The worst of Luke’s trial-by-Blackwood had passed, and as the meal continued, he found himself settling into the rhythm of it.

Grant eased back into his composed demeanor, directing the conversation toward safer ground. "So, Luke, how long have you been diving?"

Luke took a sip of his drink, grateful for the less perilous topic. "A few years. I started out as a solo healer, took contracts with a few different groups, but nothing stuck. Then Raven pulled me into all this."

Elaine hummed. "And you stayed. That says something."

Luke glanced at Raven, who didn’t comment but was watching him with quiet interest. He nodded. "Yeah, I guess it does."

The conversation flowed from there—talk of the latest guild rankings, some minor political shifts in the dungeon economy, even a few amusing stories from past dives. Grant, to Luke’s surprise, had an almost encyclopedic knowledge of dungeon history, while Elaine’s insights were sharper than they first appeared.

By the time dessert was served, Luke had relaxed enough that he almost forgot how the evening had started. Almost.

As they stood to leave, Elaine placed a light hand on his shoulder. "It was a pleasure, Luke. And I must say, if you survived tonight, you might just survive my daughter."

Luke managed a smirk. "That was the real test, wasn’t it?"

Grant gave a slow nod, eyes glinting with amusement. "Let’s just say you’ve made an impression."

Luke wasn’t entirely sure *what* kind of impression, but at least he was walking out of the house in one piece. That counted for something.
