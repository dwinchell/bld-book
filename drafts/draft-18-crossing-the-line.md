### Scene 1: "The Moment That Almost Was"

A frozen battlefield. Ice walls press in, forcing them into close quarters. They move in sync—until the fight ends, and suddenly, the tension isn’t about survival anymore.

The cold bit deep, even through their armor. The narrow crevasse left no space to move freely, no room for anything but each other.

They had fought for what felt like hours—a relentless tide of frost-coated creatures, darting through the glacial terrain with eerie precision. The battlefield was tight, suffocating, forcing them to fight within inches of each other.

And they had never moved better.

A parry, a dodge, a step forward—Raven knew where he was before he was even there. He covered her blind spots without hesitation; she turned his openings into killing blows without thinking.

The last creature fell.

Silence settled in, broken only by their ragged breathing.

Luke turned. Raven was already facing him.

They were too close.

The heat of exertion hadn’t faded yet, and neither had the pulse of adrenaline in his veins. Her eyes were dark, locked onto his—not calculating, not cold. He could still feel the ghost of her movement against him, the sharp hitch of her breath when they had almost—

Something rumbled in the ice. Another wave.

Raven blinked, the spell between them shattering like brittle frost.

"Go," she said, voice rough.

Luke exhaled sharply, tearing his gaze away as they surged forward.

The moment was gone.

### Scene 2: "The Wardens' Rest"
Hours later, in a quiet inn, Luke turns over the moment in his mind. He’s done waiting. He makes a choice.

The fire crackled low in the hearth, casting shifting patterns of light and shadow against the stone walls. The warmth of it seeped into Luke’s skin, but it did nothing to quiet his thoughts.

That moment in the crevasse—it wasn’t the first.

There had been so many.

Times when they had stood just a little too close, moved in perfect tandem, found themselves on the edge of something more. But the moment always passed.

They weren’t just partners anymore. He knew that.

And he was tired of pretending otherwise.

Across the room, Raven sat by the fire, cleaning her weapons, unbothered, unreadable.

Luke made a decision.

"Come home with me tonight."

Raven’s hands stilled. Just for a second. Then she looked up, one brow arched.

"What?"

Luke shrugged, keeping his expression neutral. “You brought me to dinner with your parents. Seemed fair.”

She studied him. Then smirked.

"You want me to have dinner with Anna?"

"No." He let the words settle. "She won’t be home tonight."

Understanding flashed in her eyes. Surprise. Amusement. Something else.

Then—

"No."

His stomach dropped. Had he miscalculated?

Then she added, deadpan, “It’s reckless. I won’t have any part of it.”

Luke blinked. She was messing with him.

"Well," he said, rising to the bait, *"if bringing someone else home tonight is what’s needed to make this work—"

Her eyes flashed. A warning—sharp, possessive, unmistakable.

Then, they both laughed.

### Scene 3: "A Look Inside"
For the first time, Raven steps into Luke’s world. She doesn’t deflect. She doesn’t run. She lets herself be there.

The lock clicked open, and Luke stepped aside, letting Raven enter first.

She moved past him without hesitation, but her sharp gaze was already cataloging everything.

Luke didn’t know what to expect. Maybe for her to make a dry comment about how small it was compared to the Blackwood estate. How plain it must seem to someone like her.

She didn’t.

Instead, she wandered deeper in, eyes flicking over the small but well-lived-in space.

Her finger ran along the edge of a bookshelf, skimming over half-organized strategy notes on the coffee table. She glanced at the kitchen, at the stack of clean dishes, the two coffee mugs.

Luke rubbed the back of his neck. “It’s... modest.”

Raven turned, tilting her head slightly. "No, but it’s charming."

That threw him. "Charming?"

Her smirk was slow. "Like you."

Luke coughed. Very aware of how little space there was between them. "Right."

She moved again, toward the window overlooking the city. For a long moment, she just stood there, watching the faint glow beyond the glass.

He waited for her to say something teasing.

Instead, her voice was quiet. Uncertain.

"I’d like to live somewhere like this."

The words hung in the air. A slow realization flickered across her face—she hadn’t meant to say that.

Luke blinked.

Raven backpedaled immediately.

"I mean—" She exhaled sharply, shaking her head. "I just meant that I like that it’s... not stifling. My home can be. Stifling, I mean. This place—" She gestured vaguely. "It feels real."

She wasn’t looking at him anymore. Her fingers curled slightly against her sleeve.

Luke didn’t press.

"Yeah," he said instead. "It is."

The silence stretched, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. Not anymore.

### Scene 4: "The First Kiss"
The quiet in the apartment stretched, thick with something unspoken.

Luke had been alone with Raven before—countless times. In dungeons, in the field, after long training sessions. But this was different. There was nothing else in their way. No imminent threat, no tactical discussion to keep their hands busy, no excuse to move apart.

Just this space—and them in it.

Raven stood by the window, arms loose at her sides, gaze flickering to his, then away.

The tension from earlier still clung to the air—the almost-moment in the crevasse. The heat of her against him, the way their movements had locked into perfect sync, the breathless way she had looked at him when the fight was over.

Luke exhaled slowly. "So… what now?"

Raven didn’t answer immediately. She tilted her head slightly, considering him the way she might analyze a new enemy—measuring the distance, the risk. Then, instead of speaking, she took a single step closer.

The air between them shifted.

It was subtle but undeniable, the kind of change that couldn’t be undone.

Luke felt it deep in his chest—not just attraction, but inevitability. A quiet understanding settling into place, as if they had already decided, already crossed this line without needing to say it out loud.

His fingers twitched at his sides, his pulse kicking up as he mirrored her movement, closing the remaining space between them.

Close. Too close.

The warmth of her skin, the faint trace of iron from the fight, the sharper scent of adrenaline still clinging to her—it hit him before her lips did. And then there was just heat.

They moved at the same time.

It wasn’t careful. It wasn’t measured. It just happened.

Her hands slid up his chest, fingers curling against his collar. His found her waist, pulling her just a fraction closer as their lips met—a soft press at first, hesitant, almost testing. But then Raven exhaled into him, and Luke’s restraint shattered.

The kiss deepened, sharp and fast, like stepping off a ledge before he could second-guess it. Raven never did anything halfway, and this was no exception—her grip tightened, her body pressing against his as if demanding more. Luke responded instinctively, hands sliding up her back, steadying her, grounding them both.

For a moment, there was nothing else.

No dungeons. No fights. No past hesitations.

Just this. Just her.

When they finally pulled back, their breaths mingling, Luke saw something rare in Raven’s expression—not confidence, not deflection. Just quiet, certain understanding.

Her lips curled slightly, voice rougher than usual. "That took long enough."

Luke let out a short, breathless laugh, forehead still close to hers. "Yeah," he murmured.
