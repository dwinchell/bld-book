## Chapter: All In

### Scene 1: "A Mind That Won’t Quiet"
The training dummy wasn’t putting up a fight, but that didn’t stop Raven from beating the hell out of it.

Her knuckles drove into synthetic padding, the impact dull compared to the sharp edge burning under her skin. She twisted into a kick, knocking the dummy back on its reinforced base, then followed with an elbow strike, the force rattling up her arm.

Still not enough.

She reset. Moved faster. Pushed harder.

The private training area her father had built for her at the Blackwood estate was cut off from the rest of the house, a space designed for her and her alone. Polished floors, reinforced walls, a full suite of equipment. No audience. No distractions. No expectations.

She needed that right now.

Needed something else to occupy her mind before it circled back—again—to the gala.

Raven slammed her palm into the dummy’s chest, sending it rocking backward. She shouldn’t be thinking about it. It was over. Done.

So why couldn’t she shake it?

She pivoted, launching into another strike, but her rhythm was off. She adjusted—no, overcorrected—her footing slipping just slightly, enough to make the next punch land weaker than intended.

She exhaled, shaking out the tension in her fingers. Frustrated. Not at the mistake—at herself.

She’d gotten too comfortable.

The entire night had been about survival—navigating society’s traps, playing by the rules just enough to slip through unscathed. She’d done it a thousand times before. But this time, she hadn’t done it alone.

That was the problem.

She hadn’t just endured the gala—she’d relied on Luke to get through it. And it hadn’t been grudging teamwork, the way it was in a dungeon. It had been… something else.

And for the first time, she wasn’t sure how to feel about that.

Her next strike was too sharp, her weight shifting forward too fast. The dummy rocked at the wrong angle, catching her off balance. She forced herself back into stance, breathing through the misstep.

Focus.

It was fine. She didn’t need to overthink this. She’d played her part, let Luke play his, and the night had ended.

She had gotten through it.

That should have been enough.

Raven clenched her jaw, pulling back for another strike—but hesitated.

That wasn’t true, was it?

If it had been enough, she wouldn’t be here, trying to drive it out of her head with brute force.

Her fists curled tighter.

She didn’t hesitate. She didn’t second-guess herself. That wasn’t who she was.

So why did it feel like she was slipping?

She turned away from the dummy, breathing deep. She needed a reset. A reminder.

Something solid. Something real.

Something she could throw herself into and know she didn’t need anyone else to get through it.

A dungeon run.

She had spent too much time letting herself feel comfortable. She needed to push past it, to remind herself what mattered.

Her heartbeat slowed. Her mind steadied.

That was the answer.

She just had to prove to herself that nothing had changed.

### Scene 2: "Going It Alone"

The dungeon’s entrance loomed before her, a black rift twisting against the backdrop of the city skyline.

Raven barely noticed.

Her mind was already ahead, calculating movement patterns, predicting enemy spawn rates, mapping escape routes before she even stepped through. The mechanics of a dungeon were simple. They made sense.

Unlike everything else.

A solo run was exactly what she needed. A clear objective. A challenge she could take on alone.

She adjusted the straps on her gear, tapped her wrist to bring up the System menu, and stepped into the portal.

The world shifted.

One second, she was standing in the portal area. The next, she was inside.

The air turned sharp and cold. The scent of damp stone and iron replaced the city’s familiar static. Crumbling pillars stretched into darkness, the architecture jagged and half-submerged in the ground like the remnants of something ancient.

The System flickered in the corner of her vision.

DUNGEON: ASHEN HALLS
Difficulty: High
Recommended Party Size: 2-4
Status: Active

Two to four.

She smirked, rolling her shoulders.

One would be enough.

Raven moved forward, steps light and quiet, knives already in her hands.

The first few waves were easy. The usual—shambling husks, skeletal knights, things that lurked in the dark corners waiting to ambush solo divers. She cut through them fast, her body settling into the familiar rhythm of strike, dodge, reposition.

This was what she needed.

No one else. No distractions. Just her, the fight, and the next step forward.

She pushed deeper into the ruins, crossing a crumbling archway into a chamber lined with flickering braziers. The heat shimmered against the damp air, casting jagged shadows against the walls.

Something stirred in the dark.

Raven turned just as the first real problem appeared.

A knight stepped into the brazier’s glow, its armor a warped, blackened shell. Hollow slits where its eyes should be. A greatsword nearly as long as she was tall resting against its shoulder.

It wasn’t alone.

Two more moved in behind it, each as massive, each radiating the kind of slow, deliberate menace that meant they weren’t mindless mobs.

She tightened her grip on her knives. Good. Finally.

The first knight moved, slamming forward in a burst of momentum.

Raven sidestepped, barely avoiding the downward swing of its sword as the stone shattered beneath it. She pivoted, coming up behind it, striking fast at the gaps in its armor—but the second knight was already there.

The strike clipped her shoulder. Not enough to stop her, but enough to break her rhythm. She corrected, twisting out of range, dropping low to reset her stance.

The first knight was already turning.

She rolled backward just as the second came in with a sweeping slash—one that should have caught her off guard.

She should have dodged left.

She always dodged left.

But Luke would have been there.

The thought was instant—so quick it barely registered before she slammed into the wall, the impact rattling through her ribs. She hissed, pushing up, but the third knight was already moving, a downward strike coming fast—

She kicked off the wall, barely clearing the swing, landing hard enough that pain flared through her side.

She was off balance.

Not in her movements, but in her head.

It had been one second—one instinctive expectation that someone else was there, covering her weak side.

And that second had nearly killed her.

Raven gritted her teeth, shoving the thought aside. She adjusted, recalibrated, forced her mind back into the fight.

The knights advanced.

### Scene 3: "A Hard Lesson"

Raven hated running

But she hated dying more.

She spun away from the knights, twisting just fast enough to avoid another heavy swing, her vision tilting slightly as the pain in her ribs sharpened.

Too much.

She’d lost too much blood. She wasn’t adjusting fast enough.

Raven’s fingers tore the cork off a health potion as she vaulted backward, the greatsword slicing just short of her chest. The thick, metallic taste hit her tongue, burning down her throat.

She needed the boost now. It wouldn’t heal instantly—slow regeneration, minor stabilization, nothing more—but it would have to be enough.

The knights didn’t slow.

Raven’s body screamed at her to stay, to fight, to correct her mistake and push through.

But even as she shifted to reset her stance, she felt it—the unsteadiness in her movements, the split-second lag in her reaction time.

She wasn’t going to win this.

She made her choice.

The moment she turned to run, the dungeon reacted.

The ground lurched beneath her.

Raven staggered, catching herself as the stone fractured outward, deep veins of black light splintering through the ruins.

The air tightened, a low tremor rolling through the chamber as the walls groaned, the ceiling shifting in warning.

Ashen Halls was rejecting her.

It was a dungeon-specific mechanic. She’d known about it going in. The mechanics rewarded aggression—but punished retreat.

If you didn’t hold your ground, the dungeon didn’t let you keep it.

A knight stepped forward, dragging its greatsword as if in mockery, the metal scraping against the stone in a long, grating hiss.

Raven moved.

The tremors intensified, each step she took widening the cracks. The ruins were coming down, and it wasn’t because of some final boss mechanic—it was because she ran.

Her lungs burned, the slow-heal potion dulling the worst of her wounds but not enough to fully restore her strength. She sprinted through a crumbling corridor, stone shards raining around her, the dungeon collapsing like a closing jaw.

The entrance was close.

She could see the rift ahead, shimmering against the darkness.

The floor buckled beneath her.

Her leg caught in the shift, her ankle twisting wrong as she hit the ground hard.

A fractured second of weightlessness—then impact.

A sharp jolt exploded through her leg.

Pain—real, immediate—ripped through her focus.

She forced herself up, pushing past the pain, half-stumbling toward the rift. Her vision blurred at the edges, her breath coming fast, but the light was right there—

One last push.

She threw herself through.

The world shifted.

One second, she was in a collapsing ruin.

The next, she was back outside.

The ground beneath her was solid again, the dungeon’s entrance now a closed void, sealed behind her.

She stood there, breathing hard, blood still slick against her ribs, her hands shaking.

She had run from the fight, and the dungeon had laughed at her for it.

### Scene 4: "A Different Kind of Defeat"

She winced as she moved to leave, a sharp pang jolting through her chest. The slow-heal potion had kept her moving, but it hadn’t erased the damage. The cut along her ribs still throbbed, her ankle still ached, and the exhaustion sat deep in her bones.

She was about to push forward, head straight for home, when a voice cut through the noise.

"You’re hurt."

She turned, reaching reflexively for her kinves, but it wasn’t a threat—just a diver leaning against a wall, a few feet away from where she’d emerged.

A healer, judging by the faint, lingering aura of system-backed magic still trailing his fingers.

His team stood nearby, still caught in the post-run adrenaline rush—one of them was counting loot credits, another gesturing through a retelling of their last encounter.

The healer, though, was watching her.

His gaze flicked over her torn gear, the shallow but unmistakably deep wound along her ribs, the stiff way she was standing.

"I’m fine," she said.

He didn’t move. "You’re bleeding."

Raven huffed, shifting her stance, not bothering to deny it. She’d be fine. It wasn’t the worst she’d ever had. It wasn’t—

The shift sent a jolt up her side. She bit back the wince.

The healer sighed. "Look, I get it. But you’ll want this cleaned up before it scars. Diver abilities don’t work as well outside a dungeon, but I can still get you patched up enough to move properly."

She knew that. Everyone knew that.

Healing magic was System-enhanced. Inside a dungeon, where the System’s influence was strongest, it could close wounds instantly, purge toxins, even undo near-fatal injuries given enough mana.

But outside?

The same abilities were blunt instruments. They still worked, but it took far more effort, far more mana, and they were only really effective on simple wounds—cuts, burns, soft tissue injuries. Anything worse, and you needed real medical attention.

Her ribs still ached.

She was tired. She didn’t want to deal with this.

She also didn’t want to make the long walk home like this.

Raven exhaled through her nose, then grudgingly lifted her arm enough to give him space to work.

He took that as permission, stepping forward, pressing his fingers just over the worst of the damage.

Warmth spread through the wound, tingling but controlled, the sharp sting of her body knitting back together dulled to a vague discomfort. It wasn’t like the dungeons—no instant reset, no clean slate—but it was enough.

"That should hold," he said, pulling back. "Take it easy for the rest of the night."

Raven rolled her shoulders out of habit—then stopped herself, jaw tightening as the thought hit before she could stop it.

She suddenly, achingly, painfully missed Luke.

Not in a sharp, dramatic way. Just in the way that mattered.

The way that meant she was standing here, accepting help from a stranger, instead of walking out of a dungeon with him by her side.

The way she never thought about whether she’d need a healer—because she always had him.

She clenched her fingers at her sides.

It wasn’t just that she was off balance.

It was that she couldn’t reach the same level on her own.

She had spent years fighting solo. Had made her reputation alone.

But now—

Now, she wasn’t as good alone as she was with him.

The realization sat heavier than the pain had.

She nodded to the healer—short, abrupt—then turned without another word, forcing herself forward, away.

She needed to go home.

She needed to not think about this.

Because if she thought about it too long, she wasn’t sure what it would make her do.

### Scene 5: "The Worst of All"

Raven sat cross-legged on her bed, her room lit only by the faint ambient light spilling in from the city skyline beyond the wide windows.

The sharp ache in her ribs was gone, the healer’s work settling in, but she still felt off.

Physically, she was fine.

Mentally?

She was doing what she always did when something didn’t sit right—she was digging for answers.

Her HUD interface flickered, panels of dungeon data scrolling past her eyes.

Leaderboards. Run times. Completion rates. Historical clear attempts. She tapped through each one, absorbing the familiar numbers, letting the information anchor her.

Numbers made sense. They told a story, a real one—not one distorted by emotion, or instinct, or hesitation.

The stats didn’t lie.

She wasn’t as fast solo as she was with a partner. The difference wasn’t enormous—but it was there.

And that shouldn’t have been the case.

Raven flicked past the leaderboard rankings, scanning the latest dungeon discussions.

The usual chatter—recent clears, rumors of new portals forming, arguments about loot drops. Then, something caught her eye.

A name she hadn’t seen in years.

Isaac Warren.

Raven’s fingers stilled.

The last known survivor of a failed Radiant Spire run.

The post was new.

A transcript from an interview he’d given just days ago—his first since vanishing after his attempt.

Raven pulled it up, her breath slowing as she read.

INTERVIEW EXCERPT: ISAAC WARREN ON THE RADIANT SPIRE

Q: People have been trying to reach you for years. Why speak now?

ISAAC: I don’t have a good answer for that. Maybe I just got tired of ignoring the messages.

Q: You were the last person to survive a Radiant Spire run. Can you tell us what happened?

ISAAC: No.

Q: No?

ISAAC: Nobody should run it.

Q: What do you mean?

ISAAC: I mean exactly that. Nobody should run it.

Q: People say the last section is the hardest. Is that true?

ISAAC: (Pause)

Q: Isaac?

ISAAC: The last part is always the hardest.

Q: But people say you and your partner almost—

ISAAC: 'Almost' is the worst of all.

Raven sat back, staring at the last line.

"Almost is the worst of all."

Something about it settled in her ribs like a weight.

She exhaled, flicking away from the interview and pulling up the Radiant Spire’s dungeon entry.

She already knew most of it—everyone did. It was infamous. It had no level assgined to it, but nobody had ever cleared it.

DUNGEON: RADIANT SPIRE
Difficulty: Extreme (Lethal)
Required Party Size: 2
Status: Uncleared

The System’s unflinching assessment.

She read the description of the dungeon.

  A floating citadel of pure light, suspended high above an endless sky.
  The Radiant Spire is not a battle of strength—it is a trial of teamwork and trust.
  Unlike other dungeons, the Spire does not seek to destroy intruders with malice—it tests them with unwavering precision. 
  Every challenge demands absolute coordination between two divers, and those who fail are not granted second chances.
  Only partners in perfect harmony will live. Only those who enter in perfect trust will survive to the end.

She skimmed the listed mechanics, reviewing them even though she could already picture the challenges in her mind.

The Luminous Ascent—a climb where the platforms only existed for one diver at a time.
The Guardians of Harmony—statues that punished even the slightest mismatch in movement.
The Bridge of Light—a path that vanished if one diver fell behind.
The Heart of Light—

Her gaze lingered on the last section.

No one knew exactly what it was.

The final chamber was an unknown. The teams who made it that far never left intact.

Isaac had been one of them. And whatever he had seen, whatever had broken his team apart, it had been enough for him to disappear for years and return with only one piece of advice:

"Nobody should run it."

She should have dismissed it.

She should have closed the HUD, laid back, forced herself to sleep.

Instead, she stared at the words for a long, quiet moment.

Then, slowly, she let herself acknowledge what she already knew.

She wanted to run it.

And she wanted to do it with Luke.

It wasn’t about the leaderboard. It wasn’t about the challenge.

It was about trust.

The Spire wasn’t a test of strength. It wasn’t about who hit harder, who moved faster.

It was about whether two people could move as one.

And she wanted to prove—to herself, to him, to the world—that they could.

That if they took this impossible thing and did it together, there wouldn’t be a single doubt left about what they were.

Her HUD flickered as she minimized the dungeon entry.

The decision settled inside her like a stone dropping into still water.

She was going to ask him.

And if he said no—

Well.

That was its own kind of answer.

### Scene 6: "The Proposal Over Ice Cream"

The night air was cool, the streets quiet except for the occasional hum of passing cars and the faint arcade music spilling from the shop next door.

Raven leaned against the counter, scanning the menu.

"Vanilla. With whipped cream."

Luke, standing beside her, let out a quiet snort.

Raven glanced at him. "What?"

"You." He gestured vaguely at her, like that explained anything. "You’re out here in all black, Night Dancer, ‘shadow of the abyss’ or whatever, and you order vanilla?"

She smirked. "Something wrong with vanilla?"

"I don’t know. Just figured you’d go for, like… midnight espresso or something appropriately dramatic."

She hummed, accepting her cup from the cashier. "Maybe I just wanted something simple for once."

Luke stepped up next, not even hesitating before placing his order. "Dark chocolate."

Raven snorted. "Of course."

Luke arched a brow as they took their seats at a small table outside. "What’s that supposed to mean?"

"Just funny. You, Mr. Caution, going for the bitterest option on the menu, and me, dressed like death, ordering vanilla." She scooped up a spoonful, giving him a mock-thoughtful look. "Symbolic, don’t you think?"

Luke smirked. "I think you’re overanalyzing your dessert."

Raven twirled her spoon. "Or maybe I’m just self-aware."

Luke chuckled, shaking his head.

The easy rhythm between them settled just right.

And that was exactly why she was about to ruin it.

She set her spoon down, tapping her fingers against the cup.

"Run the Radiant Spire with me."

The humor in Luke’s expression froze.

His hand, halfway to another bite, stopped mid-motion.

His eyes flicked to her, searching, checking if she was serious.

"You’re not serious."

"I am."

Luke exhaled, setting his cup down. The mood had shifted entirely.

"Raven."

"Luke."

"No."

She tilted her head. "You didn’t even think about it."

"I didn’t have to."

His voice was too firm. Too quick.

Raven leaned back, watching him carefully. "Why not?"

Luke ran a hand through his hair, looking genuinely frustrated. "Because it’s insane. Nobody’s ever cleared it. The people who survived didn’t even make it to the end."

"That’s why I want to do it."

Luke let out a short laugh, but there was no humor in it. "That’s exactly why we shouldn’t."

"You don’t think we could?"

"I think it’s reckless."

And there it was.

That word.

The one that made something inside her go cold.

She held his gaze, letting the silence stretch.

"So you don’t trust me."

Luke’s jaw tightened. "This isn’t about trust."

"Isn’t it?"

Something flickered across his face—hesitation. A brief crack in his certainty.

But he didn’t say it.

Instead, his next words were clipped, final.

"I won’t be part of it."

And that was what did it.

Not the logic, not the refusal—the fact that he had made the choice so easily.

And then—

"Find someone else."

The words hit harder than she expected.

Luke must have seen something shift in her expression, because his own wavered—but it was too late.

She could feel herself closing off, that sharp, instinctive need to bury whatever this was before it could hurt worse.

She gave him a small, sharp smile.

"Got it."

She stood, tossed the rest of her ice cream into the nearest bin, and turned to leave.

She heard him shift in his chair, as if he’d suddenly realized something—too late.

"Raven—"

She kept walking.

"Wait."

Her pulse flickered, but she didn’t stop.

Didn’t turn.

Didn’t even acknowledge him.

And she didn’t look back.
