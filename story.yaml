  - Luke's parents died when he was young, leaving him responsible for supporting his family.
  - Luke is is a self-taught diver.

  - Luke starts at level 20
  - Raven starts at level 17
  - Luke has been diving since age 18
  - After Luke hit level 20, he decided not to level further and stick to content he could clear easily at his current level, to minimize risk
  - Luke's performance as a healer is initially limited by the fact that he overheals because he is afraid his party members will die. This is rooted in the trauma of losing his parents.
story:

  - Raven places an ad in the System's matchmaking service for a healer, offering a generous amount of credits
  - Luke reviews and accepts Raven's matchmaking ad
  - Raven and Luke arrive separately at a staging area often used by local divers
  - They wait in the assembly area, not recognizing each other, until divers start to clear out for the day. Then Raven casually asks Luke "Are you waiting for a healer too?" Then they realize they were waiting on each other.
