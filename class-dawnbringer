  description: Used to fuel abilities with strategic trade-offs between efficiency and power.

abilities:
  direct_heals:

      cast_time: instant
      effect: 
        - restores a large amount of health to a single target.

      effect: 
        - restores a moderate amount of health to a single target.
        - applies a 1-second shield to absorb damage.
      cost: higher mana cost than radiant_mend due to the shielding effect.
      use_case: preempt or mitigate a burst.

  sustained_heals:
    - name: luminous_renewal
      cast_time: 3 seconds
      effect: 
        - restores a large amount of health over time, split into three pulses (1 per second).
      cost: mana-efficient but immobilizes the healer while casting.
      use_case: stabilizing sustained damage when lifedrain isnâ€™t enough.
    - name: beacon_of_hope
      cast_time: 2 seconds
      effect: 
        - restores moderate health to all allies within a small radius.
      cost: mana cost increases with each additional target healed.
      use_case: group-wide light but widespread damage healing.

utility_and_support:
  - name: blessing_of_dawn
    cast_time: 1.5 seconds
    effect: 
      - places a buff on the target that increases healing received by 20% for 10 seconds.
    cost: moderate mana cost.
    use_case: amplify healing during heavy damage phases.
  - name: guardian_light
    cast_time: instant
    effect: 
      - redirects 50% of damage taken by an ally to the healer for 5 seconds.

trade_offs_and_synergy:
  strengths:
    - high reactivity and burst healing potential.
    - synergizes well with a tank relying on active mitigation like aegis.
  weaknesses:
    - relatively mana-intensive, requiring careful resource management.
    - vulnerable during long cast times like luminous_renewal.
